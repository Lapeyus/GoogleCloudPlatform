# Kubernetes Object Management

- ## **Managing Pods**
  - The simplest form of managing workloads is by declaring Pod objects, specifying their state and container images.

- ## **Manifest Files**
  - Kubernetes objects are defined using manifest files, which can be written in YAML or JSON format.
  - YAML is preferred for its readability and is commonly used in documentation and courses.

- ## **Key Components of a Manifest File**
  - `apiVersion`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for the object.
  - `kind`: Defines the type of object (e.g., Pod).
  - `metadata`: Provides identifying information, including the object's name, UID, and optional namespace.


- ## **Object Identification**
  - **Name**: Unique string under 253 characters, using numbers, letters, hyphens, and periods.
  - **UID**: Unique identifier generated by Kubernetes for each object.
  - **Labels**: Key-value pairs attached to objects for organization and selection.

- ## **Using Labels and Selectors**
  - Labels categorize objects for easy querying and management.
  - `kubectl` can select resources by label, supporting operations based on presence, absence, or value of labels.

- ## **Deploying Nginx Web Servers**
  - Declaring three Pod objects in YAML to create nginx web servers.
  - Kubernetes spreads workload across nodes, maintaining desired state and high availability.

- ## **Controllers**
  - Controllers manage the state of Pods, essential for applications that require reliability and automated management.
  - Examples: 
    - Deployments 
    - StatefulSets 
    - DaemonSets 
    - Jobs.
  - **Deployment**: Ideal for managing long-lived components as a group, ensuring desired state through ReplicaSets.

- ## **Deployments**
  - A Deployment controller monitors and maintains the specified number of nginx Pods.
  - Uses ReplicaSets to manage the lifecycle of Pods, replacing failed Pods to maintain the desired state.
  - Simplifies management by using a single YAML file for the Deployment, specifying replicas, container images, and volumes.


- ## **Best Practices**
  - Group related objects in the same YAML file for easier management.
  - Version control manifest files using services like Cloud Source Repositories to track changes and facilitate cluster recreation.
  - Effective Kubernetes management relies on understanding objects, manifest files, labels, and controllers to maintain desired states and high availability.
