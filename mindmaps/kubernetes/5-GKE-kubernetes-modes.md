# GKE Operation Modes: Autopilot vs. Standard

- **Overview**
  - GKE offers two modes of operation: Autopilot and Standard, each with distinct management approaches and cost models.
  - While Autopilot mode is recommended for most users due to its efficiency and simplicity, Standard mode is available for those who need or prefer detailed control over their Kubernetes infrastructure.


- ## **Autopilot Mode**
  - **High-Level Overview**
    - Offers a hands-off management experience optimized for Kubernetes, focusing on ease of use and cost efficiency.
  - **Management and Configuration**
    - Less management overhead but with fewer configuration options.
  - **Cost**
    - Pay only for what you use, optimizing both usage and cost.
  - **Benefits**
    - Optimized for production with Google-managed best practices.
    - Automatically optimizes underlying machine types based on workloads.
    - Enhances security by locking down nodes and reducing the attack surface.
    - Promotes operational efficiency with comprehensive monitoring and managed updates.
    - You pay for Pods, not nodes, optimizing resource consumption.
  - **Functionality**
    - Quick deployment of production-ready clusters with minimal overhead.
  - **Security**
    - Strong security posture with Google managing the security of nodes and infrastructure.
  - **Operational Efficiency**
    - Monitored by Google to ensure high availability and up-to-date clusters.
  - **Restrictions**
    - More restrictive configuration options due to fully managed nature.
    - Restrictions on access to node objects, SSH, privilege escalation, and certain node affinity and host access features.
    - All Pods are scheduled with a Guaranteed class Quality of Service (QoS) but require configuration adjustments.

- ## **Standard Mode**
  - **High-Level Overview**
    - Allows Kubernetes management infrastructure to be configured in many ways, providing fine-grained control.
  - **Management and Configuration**
    - Requires more management overhead but allows for a highly customizable environment.
  - **Cost**
    - Pay for all provisioned infrastructure, regardless of usage.
  - **Benefits**
    - Full control over the cluster configuration, management, and optimization.
  - **Functionality**
    - Same core functionality as Autopilot but with responsibility for manual configuration, management, and optimization.
  - **Recommendation**
    - Suitable for scenarios requiring specific levels of configuration control not provided by Autopilot.
