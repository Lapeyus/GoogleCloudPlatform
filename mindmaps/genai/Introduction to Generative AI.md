# Introduction to Generative AI

 
## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology capable of producing content like text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data.

### Context: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- **Definition:** AI is a branch of computer science that deals with creating intelligent agents, systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
- **Relation to Physics:** AI is to computer science what physics is to science.

### Machine Learning (ML)

#### Subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning:** Systems that learn from data to make predictions on new, unseen data without being explicitly programmed.

##### Supervised Learning

- **Data Type:** Labeled data (e.g., names, types, numbers)
- **Application Example:** Predicting tips based on bill amounts in restaurants (supervised).

##### Unsupervised Learning

- **Data Type:** Unlabeled data
- **Application Example:** Clustering employees based on tenure and income to identify patterns (unsupervised).

### Deep Learning (Subset of ML)

- **Uses:** More complex patterns using artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain.
- **Data Types:** Labeled and unlabeled data (semi-supervised learning).

## Generative AI within Deep Learning

Generative AI is a subset of deep learning that involves generating new data instances.

### Types of Models in Generative AI

#### Discriminative Models

- **Purpose:** Classify or predict labels for data points.
- **How it Works:** Learns the relationship between data features and labels.

#### Generative Models

- **Purpose:** Generate new data instances.
- **How it Works:** Learns the joint probability distribution of data to generate new content.

### Generative vs. Discriminative Models

- **Generative Output Example:** Producing a new image of a dog.
- **Discriminative Output Example:** Identifying an image as a dog vs. a cat.

## Applications of Generative AI

### Generative AI can create:
- Text
- Code
- Images
- Audio
- Video

### Challenges in Generative AI

- **Hallucinations:** Nonsensical or incorrect outputs due to issues like inadequate training data or poor model constraints.

### Utilizing Prompts

- **Prompt Design:** Creating prompts that guide the model to produce the desired output.

## Model Types Based on Input

- **Text to Text:** Translates or generates text based on textual input.
- **Text to Image:** Creates images from text descriptions.
- **Text to Video:** Generates video from text scripts.
- **Text to 3D:** Produces 3D models from text descriptions.
- **Text to Task:** Performs tasks like searches or actions based on text commands.

## Foundation Models

- **Uses:** Adapt to various tasks like sentiment analysis, image captioning.
- Examples:
  - Palm API for chat and text
  - Stable Diffusion for images.

## Conclusion

- **Generative AI:** A powerful subset of AI that uses deep learning to generate new content.
- **Future Prospects:** Revolutionizing fields like healthcare, finance, customer service through applications like fraud detection and personalized support.
