        <pre><h1>Lift-and-Shift Vs. Refactoring</h1>
<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many IT teams face time or budget constraints, leading them to opt for a lift and shift approach. However, refactoring can be a better path, offering significant benefits in basic lift-and-shift migration.</p>
<h3>On-Premises vs. Cloud-Native</h3>
<p>Although lift and shift may seem easier and cheaper on-premises, it could ultimately cost more than running a cloud-native app. Additionally, there may be limitations in utilizing Google's services for monitoring, security, and governance.</p>
<h2>Refactoring as a Better Option</h2>
<p>Refactoring is often preferred over lift and shift due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance issues after lift and shift migration</li>
<li>Inability to integrate with Google's security systems, such as IAM</li>
<li>Delays and expense associated with unnecessary refactoring</li>
</ul>
<h3>Evaluating Refactoring</h3>
<p>When deciding whether to refactor an application, consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost: Ensure that refactoring does not exceed the savings in running costs.</li>
<li>Enhanced performance and security benefits</li>
<li>Return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refactoring Tools</h3>
<p>A wide variety of refactoring tools are available, catering to different programming languages and databases. Today, most tools focus on building microservices designed to consume cloud-native APIs.</p>
<h3>Shift Towards Container Development</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a shift towards container development and Kubernetes engine deployment, making these tools increasingly popular for refactoring applications in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Refactoring Strategies</h2>
<p>There are two primary approaches to refactoring:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete Refactor</strong>: This approach involves editing over 50% of the code and updating the database to benefit from cloud-native features. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can be expensive or complex.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable Refactoring</strong>: This approach prioritizes speed and efficiency, requiring only minor code changes to the application. It often results in integrating the app with cloud-native security and a cloud database into the migrated workload.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prioritizing Speed and Efficiency</h3>
<p>When choosing a refactoring strategy, consider prioritizing speed and efficiency while still achieving the desired outcomes. This approach can help minimize delays and expense associated with unnecessary refactoring.</p></pre>

        <pre>Lift-and-Shift Vs. Refactoring

Unfortunately, many IT teams face time or budget constraints, leading them to opt for a lift and shift approach. However, refactoring can often be the better path as it has significant benefits to basic lift-and-shift migration.

To virtualize your applications and their stacks in the cloud as-built, one issue is that although it may seem easier and cheaper on-premises, this approach could ultimately cost more than running a cloud-native app. Moreover, there may be an inability to properly utilize Google's services for monitoring, security, and governance.

Therefore, many believe that refactoring an application as part of a migration is a better option. This is because they have had to do so many times retrospectively due to an application's performance failing to meet benchmarks after a lift and shift migration. There are also issues when migrated applications because they are not cloud-native, making it difficult to integrate with some of Google's security systems.

However, most IT departments don't want to go through unnecessary refactoring because it adds delays and expense. So, how do you know when to refactor an application? Application developers need to contemplate several factors when evaluating their apps, considering cost as the most important factor. This is simple business logic - do not spend more money refactoring an app than will be saved in running costs.

When evaluating the return on investment (ROI), consider the cost, enhanced performance, and security benefits. Remember that ROI isn't just about money. There's a wide variety of refactoring tools available, and an application's needs vary depending on its programming languages and databases.

Today, the categories of tools lean towards refactoring in building microservices designed to consume cloud-native APIs. On the other hand, there is a shift towards container development and Kubernetes engine deployment, making these tools popular for refactoring applications for the cloud.

Refactoring Strategies

There are two ways to go about refactoring: complete refactor or minimum viable refactor. A complete refactor involves editing over 50% of the code and updating the database to benefit from many cloud-native features. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can significantly enhance performance and features but also comes with an expensive and complex process.

On the other hand, there's the option of a minimum viable refactor, prioritizing speed and efficiency. A minimal refactor only requires minor code changes to the application, often resulting in integrating the app with cloud-native security and a cloud database into the migrated workload.

        <pre><p><strong>Lift-and-Shift vs. Refactoring: Choosing the Right Approach for Cloud Migration</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to migrating applications to the cloud, IT teams often face time or budget constraints, leading them to consider a lift-and-shift approach. However, this method may not be the most cost-effective solution in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>The Drawbacks of Lift-and-Shift Migration</strong></p>
<p>Lift-and-shift migration involves replicating an on-premises application setup in the cloud, which can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher costs compared to running a cloud-native app</li>
<li>Inability to fully utilize Google's services for monitoring, security, and governance</li>
<li>Potential performance issues due to compatibility problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Refactoring</strong></p>
<p>Refactoring, on the other hand, involves modifying an application to take advantage of cloud-native features. This approach offers significant benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced performance and features to meet evolving business requirements</li>
<li>Improved integration with cloud-native security and a cloud database</li>
<li>Ability to fully utilize Google's services for monitoring, security, and governance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Refactor</strong></p>
<p>Refactoring is not always necessary, but it's essential to consider the cost-benefit analysis. Application developers should evaluate factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost: Refactoring can be expensive, so it's crucial to weigh the costs against potential savings in running costs.</li>
<li>Enhanced performance and security benefits</li>
<li>Return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Refactoring Strategies</strong></p>
<p>There are two primary refactoring strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete Refactor</strong>: This approach involves editing over 50% of the code and updating the database to benefit from cloud-native features. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can significantly enhance performance and features.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable Refactoring</strong>: This approach prioritizes speed and efficiency, requiring only minor code changes to the application. It often results in integrating the app with cloud-native security and a cloud database into the migrated workload.</li>
</ol>
<p>By considering these factors and refactoring strategies, IT teams can make informed decisions about whether to lift-and-shift or refactor their applications for a successful cloud migration.</p></pre>
