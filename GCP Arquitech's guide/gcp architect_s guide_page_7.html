        <pre><h1>Digital Transformation</h1>
<h2>Drivers of Change</h2>
<p>The obvious improvement in on-premises performance and reduced latency between applications encouraged the use of microservices, which are single function modules of code.</p>
<p>Microservices encouraged the decomposition of monolithic applications as it brought the benefits of faster development and the promise of agile development, continuous improvement through frequent updates and rapid deployment. Now large organisations' business teams were beginning to pay attention.</p>
<p>Next came containers and this is where the modern cloud technologies and large enterprise data centre technologies would eventually converge on a common architecture. Don't get me wrong though the introduction of microservices, containers and flat networks have made cloud migrations feasible but it is still not easy.</p>
<p>This is because decomposing a mission critical application into microservices or sharding vast databases into manageable components takes time and effort. However, the rewards are now scalability, flexibility, speed, redundancy, centralised security, global-reach, multi-regional caching, network efficiency and infrastructure cost effectiveness, amongst many others.</p>
<h2>Business Focus</h2>
<p>But the drivers now for modernisation or as it is called digital transformation came from the business teams and the c-suite. This turn-around from an IT-push to a C-suite and business-team's pull came-about because the need to modernise to a more pervasive digital, flexible, agile and rapid business environment was now deemed to be business critical.</p>
<p>This is because the business teams could now translate the cloud benefits to real business objectives such as wider market visibility, better customer identification and personalisation, informed and dynamic decision-making, faster time to market and advanced capability-building.</p>
<h2>ROI Framework</h2>
<p>Consequently when framing any questions regards return on investment for moving to the cloud for all but the smallest of companies or startup we should avoid stressing the cost saving benefits. The reason for this is two-fold, one it may not actually be true for larger or well established organizations.</p>
<p>Two, it is better to concentrate on composite ROI whereby you take a three tier approach. The lower tier would be regards the infrastructure Total-Cost-of Ownership (TCO) and capital investments in modernisation.</p>
<p>For a startup the value generated at this tier could be significant but for most larger organizations the CapEx and OpEx ratio will typically be neutral or even negative over 3-5 years.</p>
<p>Then we should consider the second tier which concerns Human Resources (HR) with regards to the operations and maintenance and this is where organisations can make some positive ROI due to offshoring much of the operations, management and maintenance burden and thus reducing staffing, training and administration requirements.</p>
<p>However, even at this HR tier the ROI is typically only around 5%. It is at the third tier, which measures business value that we will typically see significant return on investment. Indeed when we consider business benefits in the ROI this is where we start to see ROI in excess of 50%.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, when considering ROI for moving to the cloud you should take a holistic approach by considering infrastructure, HR and business value to reach a composite value.</p>
<p>This will require involving the business-teams in technology decision making as well as elevating IT to a become a business function with responsibilities to create business value. After all this is what digital transformation is all about.</p></pre>

Framing the ROI

Consequently when framing any questions regards return on investment for moving to the cloud for all but the smallest of companies or startup we should avoid stressing the cost saving benefits. The reason for this is two-fold, one it may not actually be true for larger or well established organizations. Two, it is better to concentrate on composite ROI whereby you take a three tier approach.

The lower tier would be regards the infrastructure Total-Cost-of-Ownership (TCO) and capital investments in modernisation. For a startup the value generated at this tier could be significant but for most larger organisations the CapEx and OpEx ratio will typically be neutral or even negative over 3-5 years. Then we should consider the second tier which concerns Human Resources (HR) with regards to the operations and maintenance and this is where organisations can make some positive ROI due to offshoring much of the operations, management and maintenance burden and thus reducing staffing, training and administration requirements.

However, even at this HR tier the ROI is typically only around 5%. It is at the third tier, which measures business value that we will typically see significant return on investment. Indeed when we consider business benefits in the ROI this is where we start to see ROI in excess of 50%.

Therefore, when considering ROI for moving to the cloud you should take a holistic approach by considering infrastructure, HR and business value to reach a composite value. This will require involving the business-teams in technology decision making as well as elevating IT to a become a business function with responsibilities to create business value. After all this is what digital transformation is all about.

        <pre><p>The shift towards cloud computing has been driven by the need for improved on-premises performance and reduced latency between applications, leading to the adoption of microservices as single-function modules of code. This decomposition of monolithic applications brought benefits such as faster development, agile development, and continuous improvement through frequent updates and rapid deployment.</p>
<p>As large organisations' business teams began to take notice, containers emerged as a key technology that converged modern cloud technologies with large enterprise data centre technologies on a common architecture. While microservices and containers have made cloud migrations feasible, the process is still not easy due to the need for decomposing mission-critical applications into manageable components.</p>
<p>However, the rewards of cloud migration are significant, including scalability, flexibility, speed, redundancy, centralised security, global-reach, multi-regional caching, network efficiency, and infrastructure cost effectiveness. The drivers for modernisation now come from business teams and the C-suite, as the need to modernise to a more pervasive digital, flexible, agile, and rapid business environment is deemed business critical.</p>
<p>The return on investment (ROI) for cloud migration should be framed in a holistic approach, considering infrastructure, Human Resources, and business value. The lower tier of ROI focuses on infrastructure Total-Cost-of-Ownership (TCO) and capital investments in modernisation, where the value generated may not be significant for larger organisations. The second tier concerns Human Resources, where organisations can make positive ROI through offshoring operations and reducing staffing requirements. However, the ROI at this tier is typically only around 5%. The third tier measures business value, where significant return on investment is seen in excess of 50%.</p>
<p>To achieve a composite value, it is essential to involve business teams in technology decision-making and elevate IT to a business function with responsibilities to create business value. This is the essence of digital transformation.</p></pre>
