        <pre><h1>Managed Instance Groups</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Managed Instance Groups can work with load balancing services to distribute network traffic to all of the instances in the group.
Furthermore, using Managed Instance Groups provides a robust automated system for maintaining service availability.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically restarts if a VM instance in the group should stop, crash, or be accidentally deleted</li>
<li>Recreated VM instance uses the same name and instance template as the previous instance</li>
<li>Useful for identifying and recreating unhealthy instances in a group</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Managed Instance Groups</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance template using the console.</li>
<li>Use the instance template to create a managed instance group of 'n' specified instances.</li>
<li>Define specific rules to apply to the instance group, such as:</li>
<li>Single or multi zoned?</li>
<li>Location of instances?</li>
<li>Ports allowed and load balanced?</li>
<li>Auto scaling criteria?</li>
<li>Minimum and maximum number of instances?</li>
<li>Health check criteria?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rules for Health Check</h3>
<ul>
<li>Configurable with complex criteria and thresholds</li>
<li>Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL or TLS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regional Managed Instance Groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can distribute instances across multiple zones in the same region</li>

        <pre>The relevance of Managed Instance Groups in this chapter is that they can work with load balancing services to distribute network traffic to all of the instances in the group. Furthermore, using Managed Instance Groups provides a robust automated system for maintaining service availability.

For example, if a VM instance in the group stops, crashes, or is accidentally deleted, the managed instance group will automatically restart it and recreate the VM so that it can resume its place in the group and continue processing tasks. A notable feature of this process is that the recreated VM instance uses the same name and instance template as the previous instance, even if the group references a different instance template.

Another caveat is that restarting and recreating an instance does not occur if the instance was stopped or deleted via the instance group's commands. Additionally, Managed Instance Groups are useful in identifying and recreating unhealthy instances in a group, ensuring that all instances in a group are running optimally.

You can create regional Managed Instance Groups, which distribute instances across multiple zones in the same region, supporting autoscaling, network load balancing, and HTTPS load balancing. Creating these groups is straightforward: you create an instance template using the console, then use this template to create a managed instance group of 'n' specified instances.

During the creation process, you can define specific rules to apply to the instance group, such as whether it should be single or multi-zoned, where instances will be located, and what ports are allowed and load balanced. You can also configure autoscaling criteria, health check settings, and periodicity for the health check.

The health check capabilities built-in for managing instance groups support HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL/TLS protocols, allowing you to configure complex criteria and thresholds to determine when an instance is unhealthy.

        <pre><h3>Managed Instance Groups in Azure: Key Features and Benefits</h3>
<p>Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) play a crucial role in ensuring high availability and scalability of applications running on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). By leveraging MIGs, users can create robust automated systems for maintaining service availability.</p>
<h4>Key Features of Managed Instance Groups</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: MIGs can work with load balancing services to distribute network traffic to all instances in the group.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Service Availability</strong>: If a VM instance in the group stops, crashes, or is deleted, the managed instance group will automatically restart it. Additionally, if an instance needs to be recreated, the new instance will use the same name and instance template as the previous one.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Support</strong>: MIGs can be created across multiple zones within a region, providing improved availability and scalability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Managed Instance Groups</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Service Availability</strong>: By automatically restarting or recreating instances, MIGs ensure that applications remain available even in the event of failures.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Scalability</strong>: MIGs enable users to scale their applications up or down as needed, without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Health Check Capabilities</strong>: Built-in health check capabilities allow users to configure complex criteria and thresholds for determining instance health.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Creating Managed Instance Groups</h4>
<p>To create an MIG, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance template using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.</li>
<li>Use the instance template to create a managed instance group with 'n' specified instances.</li>
<li>Define specific rules for the instance group, including:<ul>
<li>Zone configuration (single or multi-zoned)</li>
<li>Instance location</li>
<li>Port configuration and load balancing</li>
<li>Autoscaling settings</li>
<li>Minimum and maximum instance count criteria</li>
<li>Health check criteria with periodicity and method options</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By leveraging Managed Instance Groups, users can create robust automated systems for maintaining service availability, scalability, and high performance in their Azure-based applications.</p></pre>
