        <pre>Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy, and managed way to run Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Pig on Google Cloud Platform. All you have to do is request a Hadoop cluster. It will be built for you in 90 seconds or less on top of Compute Engine virtual machines whose number and type you may control. If you need more or less processing power while your cluster is running, you can scale it up or down at will.

You can use the default configuration for the Hadoop software in your cluster or you can customize it. Also, you can monitor your cluster using Stackdriver. A significant attraction to running Big Data and Dataproc is that when running Hadoop on-premises, it requires a major capital hardware investment and considerable operational costs. On the other hand, running these Hadoop jobs in Cloud Dataproc allows you to only pay for hardware resources used during the life of the cluster you create, so there is no capital investment (CapEx) and little in comparison to on-premises operation expenditure (OpEx).

Although the rate for pricing is based on the hour, Cloud Dataproc is built by the second. GCP's Cloud Dataproc clusters are built in one-second clock time increments and subject to a one-minute minimum billing. So, remember when you're finished using your cluster, you should delete it as then the billing stops. This is a much more agile use of resources than on-premises hardware assets.

You can also save money by telling Cloud Dataproc to use pre-emptible Compute Engine instances for your batch processing. However, you must make sure that your jobs can be restarted cleanly if they're terminated. But if they can be stopped gracefully restarted, then you can get a significant discount in the cost of running the VM instances - around 80 percent cheaper.

Be aware that the cost of the Compute Engine instances isn't the only component of the cost of a Dataproc cluster, but it's a significant one. Once your data is in a cluster, you can use Spark and Spark SQL to do data mining. And you can use MLib, which are Apache Spark's machine learning libraries to discover patterns through machine learning.

Cloud Dataproc is great when you have a data set of known size or when you want to manage your cluster size yourself. However, what if your data shows up in real-time or its arrival is of unpredictable size or rate? That's where Cloud Dataflow is a particularly good choice.

Cloud Dataflow is a fully-managed ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) service that is equally capable of handling streaming data in real-time and/or historical data in batch mode. Cloud Dataflow is serverless, which means there is no need for resource provisioning and management, Google handles all this for you. However, with Dataflow, you still have access to almost infinite capacity to leverage against your toughest data processing and analysis challenges.

You can use Dataflow to build data pipelines via expressive SQL, Java, and Python APIs in the Apache Beam SDK, and these pipelines work for both batch and streaming data with equal reliability. There's no need to spin up a cluster or to size instances as Cloud Dataflow will fully automate the management of whatever processing resources are required.

Cloud Dataflow frees you from operational tasks like resource management and performance optimization.

        <pre><p><strong>Google Cloud Platform's Managed Big Data Services: Dataproc and Dataflow</strong></p>
<p>Google Cloud Platform offers two managed big data services, Dataproc and Dataflow, to help users process and analyze large datasets efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Dataproc: A Fast and Easy Way to Run Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Pig</strong></p>
<p>Dataproc is a fast, easy, and managed way to run Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Pig on Google Cloud Platform. Users can request a Hadoop cluster in under 90 seconds, which can be scaled up or down as needed. Dataproc allows users to customize the configuration of their cluster and monitor it using Stackdriver.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of running big data workloads on Dataproc is that it eliminates the need for major capital hardware investments and operational costs associated with on-premises infrastructure. Users only pay for the resources used during the life of the cluster, making it a cost-effective solution.</p>
<p><strong>Dataproc Pricing</strong></p>
<p>While the pricing for Dataproc is based on hourly rates, the service is built by the second, allowing for precise billing. However, users should be aware that Compute Engine instances are just one component of the overall cost of a Dataproc cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Savings with Preemptible Instances</strong></p>
<p>Users can save up to 80% on costs by using preemptible Compute Engine instances for batch processing. However, they must ensure that their jobs can be restarted cleanly if terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Dataflow: A Fully-Managed ETL Service</strong></p>
<p>Cloud Dataflow is a fully-managed ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) service that can handle both streaming data in real-time and historical data in batch mode. It is serverless, eliminating the need for resource provisioning and management.</p>
<p>Users can build data pipelines using expressive SQL, Java, and Python APIs in the Apache Beam SDK, which work for both batch and streaming data with equal reliability. Cloud Dataflow automates the management of processing resources required, freeing users from operational tasks like resource management and performance optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Between Dataproc and Dataflow</strong></p>
<p>Dataproc is suitable for users who have a known dataset size or want to manage their cluster size themselves. However, if your data arrives in real-time or has an unpredictable arrival rate, Cloud Dataflow is a better choice due to its ability to handle streaming data and provide infinite capacity for complex data processing challenges.</p></pre>
