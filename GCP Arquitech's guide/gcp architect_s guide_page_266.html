        <pre><h1>Migrating MySQL and PostgreSQL to Google Cloud Platform</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Platform natively supports MySQL and PostgreSQL within its Cloud SQL service. This means that migrating either of these databases to the cloud is going to be reasonably straightforward.</p>
<h2>Steps for Moving an On-Premises MySQL or PostgreSQL DB Instance to the Cloud SQL</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Select the Project</h2>
Select the project you wish to use.</li>
<li>
<h2>Create a Cloud SQL Instance</h2>
<p>From the navigation menu, select the "Storage -&gt; SQL" menu item.
Click the "Create instance" button.
Choose between a "First Generation" or "Second Generation" instance. (2nd is advisable as it has better performance at a lower cost but doesn't support MySQL version older than 5.6)
Create a DB instance ID
Choose a location where you was your database to reside
Choose a VM type
Choose the storage capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Configure Access Control and Users</h2>
<p>Click create
From the instance page click on the DB instance ID
Click the "Access control" tab and the "Authorization" sub-tab. Click the "Add network" button and enter the public IP address of the server
On the same page, select the "Users" sub-tab. Click the "Change root password" button and enter a new password for the MySQL root user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Migrate Data Schema and Data</h2>
<p>You can now migrate your application database to Google Cloud SQL. However, before you do this, you must disable write access to the application so that the original and new databases stay in sync.
The way that you copy over your data schema and data is to do a sqldump and then copy that up to a storage bucket in Cloud Storage . Then you can reference that bucket as the source for the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Configure Replication (Optional)</h2>
<p>However, if you cannot take the on-premises SQL server offline during the SQLdump transfer then you will need to create a replication session on the master on-premises SQL server and make the cloud SQL server the slave. This will ensure that eventually the two will synchronise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<p>You then can stop the replication session or simply promote the cloud slave to a stand-alone instance.
Disconnect the replication from master to slave.
Restart your applications, which should now be pointing to the Cloud SQL instance.</p>
</li>

        <pre>Migrating MySQL and PostgreSQL to Google Cloud Platform
Google Cloud Platform natively supports MySQL and PostgreSQL within its Cloud SQL service. Moreover, these are not just compatible versions they are the actual databases that you would deploy on-premises. This means that migrating either of MySQL or PostgreSQL is going to be reasonably straightforward.

Steps for Moving an On-Premises MySQL or PostgreSQL DB Instance to the Cloud SQL:

1. Select the project you wish to use.
2. From the navigation menu, select the "Storage -> SQL" menu item.
3. Click the "Create instance" button.
4. Choose between a "First Generation" or "Second Generation" instance. (2nd is advisable as it has better performance at a lower cost but doesn't support MySQL version older than 5.6)
5. Create a DB instance ID
6. Choose a location where you was your database to reside
7. Choose a VM type
8. Choose the storage capacity
9. Click create

From the instance page, click on the DB instance ID and then:

11. Click the "Access control" tab and the "Authorization" sub-tab. Click the "Add network" button and enter the public IP address of the server.
12. On the same page, select the "Users" sub-tab. Click the "Change root password" button and enter a new password for the MySQL root user.

You can now migrate your application database to Google Cloud SQL. However, before you do this, you must disable write access to the application so that the original and new databases stay in sync.

Copying Over Data Schema and Data
The way that you copy over your data schema and data is to do a sqldump and then copy that up to a storage bucket in Cloud Storage. Then you can reference that bucket as the source for the database. However, if you cannot take the on-premises SQL server offline during the SQLdump transfer, then you will need to create a replication session on the master on-premises SQL server and make the cloud SQL server the slave.

This procedure requires you to complete the following high-level steps:

1. Configure your source on-premises database server for replication to Cloud SQL.
2. Make the on-premises SQL server the master and the cloud SQL the slave (replica).
3. When the cloud-based slave is fully synchronized with the source database server, take your applications offline, and update the applications to point to the cloud SQL database instance.
4. Disconnect the replication from master to slave.
5. Restart your applications, which should now be pointing to the Cloud SQL instance.

Note: The steps for migrating MySQL and PostgreSQL are similar, but there are some differences in the requirements and procedures.

        <pre><h1>Migrating MySQL and PostgreSQL to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h1>
<p>Google Cloud Platform natively supports MySQL and PostgreSQL within its Cloud SQL service. These databases are not just compatible versions but actual databases that can be deployed on-premises.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonably Straightforward Process</strong></p>
<p>Typically, migrating an on-premises MySQL or PostgreSQL database to the cloud is a straightforward process. The steps involved are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select Project and Create Instance</strong><ul>
<li>Select the project you wish to use.</li>
<li>From the navigation menu, select "Storage -&gt; SQL".</li>
<li>Click the "Create instance" button.</li>
<li>Choose between a "First Generation" or "Second Generation" instance (2nd is advisable for better performance at a lower cost).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configure Instance Settings</strong><ul>
<li>Create a DB instance ID.</li>
<li>Choose a location where your database will reside.</li>
<li>Choose a VM type and storage capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Access Control and Security</strong><ul>
<li>Click the "Access control" tab and select the "Authorization" sub-tab.</li>
<li>Click the "Add network" button and enter the public IP address of the server.</li>
<li>Select the "Users" sub-tab and click the "Change root password" button to update the MySQL root user's password.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Migrating Data Schema and Data</strong></p>
<p>To migrate your data schema and data, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sqldump</strong>: Perform a sqldump of your on-premises database.</li>
<li><strong>Copy to Cloud Storage</strong>: Copy the sqldump to a storage bucket in Cloud Storage.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Bucket as Source</strong>: Reference the bucket as the source for your cloud SQL instance.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you cannot take your on-premises SQL server offline during the SQLdump transfer, you will need to create a replication session on the master on-premises SQL server and make the cloud SQL server the slave. This ensures that eventually, the two databases will synchronize.</p>
<p><strong>High-Level Steps for Replication</strong></p>
<p>To complete the replication process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configure Source Database Server</strong>: Configure your source on-premises database server for replication to Cloud SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Make On-Premises Server Master and Cloud SQL Slave</strong>: Make the on-premises SQL server the master and the cloud SQL server the slave (replica).</li>
<li><strong>Synchronize Databases</strong>: Wait for the cloud-based slave to be fully synchronized with the source database server.</li>
<li><strong>Take Applications Offline</strong>: Take your applications offline and update them to point to the cloud SQL database instance.</li>
<li><strong>Disconnect Replication</strong>: Disconnect the replication from master to slave.</li>
<li><strong>Restart Applications</strong>: Restart your applications, which should now be pointing to the Cloud SQL instance.</li>
