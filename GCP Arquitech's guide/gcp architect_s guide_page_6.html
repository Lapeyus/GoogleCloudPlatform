        <pre><h1>Security Concerns in Cloud Adoption for Larger Organisations</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Cloud Adoption Challenges</h2>
<p>Security was the main obstacle to cloud adoption for larger organisations. Indeed even with SaaS there had been concerns regarding the multi-tenant models and data segregation between cloud customers.</p>
<h2>Complexity of Running Multi, Hybrid or Private Clouds</h2>
<p>Another concern for big companies was regards the added complexity of running multi, hybrid or private clouds as there was not one single solution for businesses operating proprietary technologies. This can be demonstrated through the understandable concerns of moving mission critical databases or applications to a single cloud provider.</p>
<h3>Challenges in Migrating Proprietary Solutions</h3>
<p>The easiest and generally best solutions would be the migration of the proprietary solutions such as Oracle, IBM and Microsoft databases and applications to their respective vendor clouds. However, for large enterprises these databases and applications are not just mission-critical they also tend to be huge. This makes them unsuitable for running within a VM due to their scale and performance requirements.</p>
<h3>Multi-Cloud Solutions Raise More Issues</h3>
<p>But of course, a multi-cloud solution raises more issues as these applications and databases often need to communicate with one another so this added another layer of network latency and security complexity.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Cloud Adoption for Small Companies</h2>
<p>On the other hand for small companies migrating to the cloud made perfect sense once they could be reassured of any security concerns. They could migrate their Oracle, IBM DB and SQL Server solutions easily as they could run them intact within VMs on the same cloud. This mitigated many of the security and inter-communications latency issues.</p>
<h2>Overcoming Hurdles for Enterprise Cloud Adoption</h2>
<p>But for the enterprise there still was significant hurdles to be overcome, such as decomposing vast monolithic applications and huge databases, would take a lot of time and money with little in the way of obvious rewards. The major issue being was that organisations thought of moving to the cloud simply in terms of technology upgrade and an expensive upgrade at that.</p>
<h3>Lack of Business Differentiation</h3>
<p>They did not see it as a business or cost differentiator as there was no barriers to entry, if you could do it so could anyone else. Furthermore the much heralded cost-efficiencies didn't really work at their scale.</p>
<h2>Shift in Enterprise IT Mindset with SDN, Microservices and Containers</h2>
<p>The re-emergence of interest around 2010 in SDN, microservices and containers changed the enterprise IT mindset. For now the focus was on moving away from the 3-tier data centre structure and moving to faster layer-2 architecture.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Layer-2 Architecture</h3>
<p>This model supported monolith applications and huge data bases on massive server clusters. However the 3-tier model also added latency between the layers as traffic had to pass through physical routers and often firewalls at the layer boundaries. The layer-2 model however was faster as there was no inter-layer communications as everything was on the same flat Ethernet network.</p>
<h3>Centralized Security and Virtual Firewall Rules</h3>
<p>This meant everything could communicate directly with everything else - if it was permitted - on a common network with the security and virtual firewall rules enforced centrally by the SDN network.</p></pre>

For now, the focus was on moving away from the 3-tier data centre structure and moving to faster layer-2 architecture. The former was how data centres were previously designed and client/server applications built and deployed.

This model supported monolith applications and huge databases on massive server clusters. However, the 3-tier model also added latency between the layers as traffic had to pass through physical routers and often firewalls at the layer boundaries. The layer-2 model, however, was faster as there was no inter-layer communications as everything was on the same flat Ethernet network.

<p>Security was a significant obstacle to cloud adoption for larger organizations, even with Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. The main concerns were multi-tenant models and data segregation between cloud customers, as well as the added complexity of running multiple, hybrid, or private clouds.</p>
<p>The difficulty in migrating mission-critical databases and applications to a single cloud provider was a major issue. Large enterprises' proprietary technologies, such as Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft databases and applications, were not suitable for running within virtual machines (VMs) due to their scale and performance requirements. A multi-cloud solution raised more issues, including network latency and security complexity.</p>
<p>In contrast, small companies found cloud adoption more appealing once security concerns were addressed. They could migrate their Oracle, IBM DB, and SQL Server solutions easily by running them intact within VMs on the same cloud, mitigating many security and inter-communications latency issues.</p>
<p>However, for large enterprises, there were significant hurdles to overcome, such as decomposing vast monolithic applications and huge databases, which required substantial time and money with little obvious rewards. Organizations often viewed cloud migration as a technology upgrade rather than a business or cost differentiator, as there were no barriers to entry. The promised cost-efficiencies also did not materialize at their scale.</p>
<p>The re-emergence of interest in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), microservices, and containers around 2010 changed the enterprise IT mindset. The focus shifted from the traditional 3-tier data centre structure to a faster layer-2 architecture. This new approach eliminated latency between layers by using a flat Ethernet network with security and virtual firewall rules enforced centrally by the SDN network.</p>
