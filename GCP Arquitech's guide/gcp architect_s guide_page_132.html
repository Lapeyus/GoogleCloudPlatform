        <pre><h1>Cloud Storage</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud Storage is designed for storing unstructured data at scale. It provides petabytes and even exabytes of capacity.</p>
<h3>Classes of Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>There are four classes of Cloud Storage:
- <strong>Regional</strong>: Suitable for frequently accessed data.
- <strong>Multi-region</strong>: Suitable for data that needs to be accessible from multiple regions.
- <strong>Nearline</strong>: Suitable for less frequently accessed data.
- <strong>Coldline</strong>: Suitable for archival data.</p>
<h2>Properties, Characteristics and Usability</h2>
<p>Cloud storage is perfect for unstructured data because it's simply a big bucket where you can store objects of variable size and type. This makes it the perfect staging point for ingress data into GCP.</p>
<h3>Storing Data in Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>Once you've uploaded data to GCP, you'll typically upload it to a cloud storage bucket before sending it to its final destination, such as Cloud SQL.</p>
<h2>Components of Cloud Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buckets</strong>: Required to have a globally unique name and cannot be nested. Objects within these buckets inherit the storage class of the bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong>: Can be text files, doc files, video files, etc. There's no minimum size limit for objects in cloud storage.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Classes</strong>: Can be changed after creation, but some changes are not allowed (e.g., changing a regional bucket to a multi-regional one).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessing Data in Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>Data can be accessed using the SDK tool commands in the console or through JSON or XML API's.</p>
<h3>Limitations of Cloud Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>There's no easy way to index all files like you would in a file system.</li>
<li>Creating directories just points to other objects, defeating the purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing Storage Classes and Moving Objects</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can change the default storage class of a bucket but not regional or multi-regional buckets to another type.</li>
<li>Regional or multi-regional buckets can be changed to coldline and nearline storage classes.</li>
<li>Objects can be moved from one bucket to another using the GCP console, but moving objects between different storage classes requires the gsutil command-line tool.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>Cloud Storage
There are four classes of Cloud Storage: regional, multi-region, nearline, and Coldline. We have discussed these types earlier along with their properties, characteristics, and usability. In this chapter, we will look under the bonnet to see how they store and access data in their own specific ways. We will also see how we can control individual, group, or service accounts to protect the data and control the authorized access that they may require via IAM.

Cloud storage is perfect for unstructured data because conceptually it is simply a big bucket where you store objects, which are unstructured blobs of variable size and type of data, in that bucket. This makes it the perfect staging point for ingress data into GCP. As a result when you upload data to GCP, you will typically initially upload it into a cloud storage bucket before it is sent to its final storage destination, such as Cloud SQL.

So let's look at how cloud storage works and break it down into a couple of different components. First, there are buckets, which are required to have a globally unique name, and they cannot be nested. The data that you point to in those buckets are objects that inherit the storage class of the bucket, and those objects could be text files, doc files, video files, etc. There's no minimum size to those objects, and you can scale this as much as you want as long as your code allows it.

To access the data, you can use the SDK tool commands in the console, or either the JSON or XML API's. We will look at how to access objects later in the chapter. This is because the concept of an unstructured data bucket where you simply dump your diverse data makes it very flexible and intuitive to use. Indeed, you don't have to worry about schemas; you just dump the data as it is, and Cloud storage provides you with a URL to access it.

Conceptually, it is just a lump of data - a blob - so it can be anything from raw text such as log files to video files. It doesn't matter to cloud storage. There is no easy way to index all of these files like you would in a file system; all you have is a specific URL to access each object in the bucket. You can create directories, but that is just another object that points to the various objects in the bucket, so it kind of defeats the purpose.

For now, let's consider that once you've created a bucket, you might want to change the storage class of that bucket. There are several caveats here that you should be aware of:

* The first is that you can change the default storage classes of a bucket, but you cannot change a regional bucket to a multi-regional and vice-versa.
* Second, a regional or a multi-regional can be changed to coldline and nearline storage classes.
* Third, you are able to move objects from one bucket to another using the GCP console. However, moving objects to buckets of different storage classes requires using the gsutil command-line tool in the console.

</ul>
<h3>How Cloud Storage Works</h3>
<p>Cloud storage works by breaking down into two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buckets</strong>: required to have a globally unique name and cannot be nested.</li>

<h3>Flexibility of Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>Cloud storage is flexible because it allows you to dump your diverse data into a bucket without worrying about schemas. You simply upload the data and get a URL to access it.</p>
<p>However, there are some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no easy way to index all files like in a file system.</li>

<p>There are four classes of cloud storage: regional, multi-region, nearline, and Coldline.
