        <pre><h1>Cloud Dimensioning</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Dimensioning</h2>
<p>Designing optimal systems requires both forecasting for future demand and planning the resources for a system to meet that requirement, this is called dimensioning.</p>
<h3>Challenges of Dimensioning</h3>
<p>What makes dimensioning difficult is that optimizing for one factor by changing a resource properties can have other unforeseen consequences. For example, if you reconfigure the VM to optimize CPU capacity this can have a negative effect on network throughput and even memory and disk capacity.</p>
<h2>Importance of Resiliency</h2>
<p>A common error made by designers is to be too ambitious when trying to dimension the system and they tend to optimize away resiliency. Remember that overcapacity or overprovisioning of a system is sometimes necessary and thus included by design to handle volatile periods, growth, or absorb the short term effects of an intentional attack.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Overprovisioning</h3>
<p>This failure to recognize and accept the purpose of overprovisioning and subsequently reducing excess capacity in order to save money can create a perfect environment for cascade failures. On the other hand, we must be aware of the price/performance balance but something to keep in mind is that cost optimization is built in to many GCP services.</p>
<h2>Capacity Planning</h2>
<p>Capacity planning is an iterative process and by that we mean it is cyclical and seemingly perpetual. There are various common measures of sufficient capacity depending on the perspective and workload estimations. But these are all load and demand dependent, which will likely fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Key Principles of Capacity Planning</h3>
<p>Therefore we can only design for sufficient capacity based upon forecasting and then monitor and adjust as the system goes into production and faces up to real world demand. We will need to monitor and measure for VM instance capacity, disk performance, network throughput, and workload demand.</p>
<p>Regardless, capacity planning all comes down to answering; are there sufficient resources with reasonable certainty?</p>
<h2>Allowance for Change</h2>
<p>A key design principle in capacity planning is to allow other factors to influence your design and then come back and dimension later. This is because forecasting is never going to be perfect so you will likely have to change some of the design for capacity or for better pricing, at a later date.</p>
<p>However at least then they will be informed decisions based on environmental measurements so you can make these adjustments knowing what benefits you may well be trading in return for reduced cost.</p></pre>

        <pre>Chapter 28- Cloud Dimensioning

Designing optimal systems requires both forecasting for future demand and planning the resources for a system to meet that requirement, this is called dimensioning. What makes dimensioning difficult is that optimizing for one factor by changing a resource properties can have other unforeseen consequences. For example, if you reconfigure the VM to optimize CPU capacity, this can have a negative effect on network throughput and even memory and disk capacity.

As a result, dimensioning requires a lot of careful planning and calculations to ensure there's sufficient capacity to meet your design goals. A common error made by designers is to be too ambitious when trying to dimension the system and they tend to optimize away resiliency. Remember that overcapacity or overprovisioning of a system is sometimes necessary and thus included by design to handle volatile periods, growth, or absorb the short-term effects of an intentional attack.

This failure to recognize and accept the purpose of overprovisioning and subsequently reducing excess capacity in order to save money can create a perfect environment for cascade failures. On the other hand, we must be aware of the price/performance balance but something to keep in mind is that cost optimization is built into many GCP services.

For example, in Google Compute Engine, it has a recommendation engine, which monitors your resource utilization over a 30-day period and makes recommendations on instance sizing. For instance, it will inform you that using a smaller configuration might save you money.

Capacity Planning

Capacity planning is an iterative process and by that we mean it is cyclical and seemingly perpetual. There are various common measures of sufficient capacity depending on the perspective and workload estimations. But these are all load and demand-dependent, which will likely fluctuate.

Therefore, we can only design for sufficient capacity based upon forecasting and then monitor and adjust as the system goes into production and faces up to real-world demand. We will need to monitor and measure for VM instance capacity, disk performance, network throughput, and workload demand.

Regardless, capacity planning all comes down to answering: are there sufficient resources with reasonable certainty? A key design principle in capacity planning is to allow other factors to influence your design and then come back and dimension later.

This is because forecasting is never going to be perfect, so you will likely have to change some of the design for capacity or for better pricing at a later date. However, at least then they will be informed decisions based on environmental measurements, so you can make these adjustments knowing what benefits you may well be trading in return for reduced cost.

        <pre><h3>Cloud Dimensioning: A Delicate Balance of Optimization and Resilience</h3>
<p>Designing optimal systems requires careful planning and dimensioning to meet future demand. However, optimizing one factor can have unforeseen consequences on other aspects of the system.</p>
<h4>The Challenges of Dimensioning</h4>
<p>Dimensioning is a complex process that involves forecasting demand and planning resources to meet it. Optimizing for one factor, such as CPU capacity, can negatively impact network throughput and memory/disk capacity. This highlights the need for careful planning and calculations to ensure sufficient capacity.</p>
<p>A common mistake made by designers is to be too ambitious when trying to dimension the system, which can lead to optimizing away resiliency. Overprovisioning or overcapacity may be necessary to handle volatile periods, growth, or intentional attacks. However, reducing excess capacity to save money can create a perfect environment for cascade failures.</p>
<h4>The Importance of Price/Performance Balance</h4>
<p>While cost optimization is built into many GCP services, such as Google Compute Engine's recommendation engine, it's essential to be aware of the price/performance balance. This involves understanding that cost optimization may require trade-offs in terms of performance or resiliency.</p>
<h3>Capacity Planning: An Iterative Process</h3>
<p>Capacity planning is an iterative process that requires cyclical and seemingly perpetual effort. It involves forecasting demand and designing for sufficient capacity based on load and demand estimations. However, these estimates are often subject to fluctuation, making it essential to monitor and adjust as the system goes into production.</p>
<p>Key considerations in capacity planning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring VM instance capacity, disk performance, network throughput, and workload demand</li>
<li>Allowing other factors to influence design and revisiting later for informed decisions based on environmental measurements</li>
<li>Ensuring sufficient resources with reasonable certainty</li>
</ul>
<p>By acknowledging the complexities of dimensioning and capacity planning, designers can create systems that balance optimization and resiliency, ensuring a perfect environment for success.</p></pre>
