        <pre>Design Thinking
Design thinking is an iterative approach to problem solving that intentionally seeks out people with different perspectives, knowledge, skills and experience and has them work together to create a practical solution for a real-world problem.

out
Design thinking uses a process-based approach to solve problems and like any process, it involves a series of steps that are carried in a particular order to achieve a goal. In this case, the goal is to identify a solution that is capable of succeeding, can be carried out in a timely manner, is cost effective, fit for purpose, and is likely to be accepted by all stakeholders.

The 5 Steps of Design Thinking
The five steps in design thinking are empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. Therefore, as we are using the iterative design process, we will start by defining the service. If you are creating a new service, it's recommended that you just start out with something rough, a prototype or proof of concept model. What this means is that we will not initially concern ourselves with making it scalable or highly available as we will just concentrate on getting its core functionality working.

Once we have our proof of concept, and can demonstrate it working, then we can take a more structured design approach. So, in the beginning, get a good grounding of the use case and what you are trying to achieve by asking yourself, the team and the stakeholders some questions about how the design is going to handle specific scenarios.

Once you have a good understanding of the use case, you can then start identifying the system's specifications and requirements as well as the deliverables, such as the service objectives (SLO) and setting measurable metrics, known as service level indicators (SLI), that will allow us to define the project goals.

Four-Tier Design Methodology
When we start working on our design, we're going to move through our four-tier architecture. The first tier we visit is going to be addressing the presentation layer, and that's the underlying infrastructure and networking. Later, we progress to contemplate the business logic. It is at this business logic tier that we will plan exactly how our service is going to work.

This is where we will decide which components will provide the features and functions that comprise all those little bits of logic that we will need to occur to drive our design. It is then that we begin to understand the different attributes that should be applied to those components. Fortunately, though modern design is less about reinventing the wheel and much more about reimagining and assembling tried and tested functional building blocks.

Of course, there is always going to be data that needs to persist so we have to store our data somewhere. This is the purpose of the 3rd tier, the data layer. When we visit this tier, we will need to understand what our data is going to look like. Will it be structured or unstructured? Will it be a relational database or just static storage?

Design thinking is an iterative approach to problem solving that intentionally seeks out people with different perspectives, knowledge, skills and experience to create a practical solution for a real-world problem.</p>
<p>The 5 Steps of Design Thinking
The five steps in design thinking are empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. The process starts by defining the service, focusing on getting its core functionality working rather than scalability or high availability. A proof of concept model is recommended to demonstrate the service's feasibility.</p>
<p>Once the proof of concept is established, a more structured design approach can be taken. This involves understanding the use case, identifying system specifications and requirements, and setting measurable metrics such as service level indicators (SLI). The project goals are then defined based on these parameters.</p>
<p>Four-Tier Design Methodology
The four-tier architecture is used to plan the design. The first tier addresses the presentation layer, including infrastructure and networking. The second tier focuses on business logic, where components and features are planned and attributes applied. The third tier, the data layer, stores data, considering its structure and storage requirements.</p>
<p>Modern design emphasizes reimagining and assembling tried functional building blocks rather than reinventing the wheel. Data persistence is crucial, and understanding its nature is essential for designing an effective system.</p></pre>

<h3>Topic 2: Four-Tier Architecture</h3>
<p>The four-tier architecture consists of the presentation layer, business logic tier, data layer, and infrastructure/networking. The design process involves addressing each tier in sequence to plan exactly how the service is going to work.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Service Development</h3>
<p>Service development involves defining the service, identifying system specifications and requirements, setting deliverables such as service objectives (SLO) and measurable metrics (SLI), and understanding the use case. The design process starts with a rough prototype or proof of concept model and progresses to a more structured design approach.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Data Storage</h3>
<p>Data storage is an essential aspect of modern design, requiring consideration of data structure, relational databases, and static storage options.</p></pre>
