        <pre><h1>Shared VPC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Shared VPC allows for the creation of a shared VPC that is named the host VPC, which can share its network of private IP subnets and their attached resources with all the associated projects called service projects.</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>VMs and their application and users can then share the use of the resources in the host VPC, which means that a service project will not even require its own network let alone any dedicated resources.</p>
<h2>Shared VPC Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow project admins to create VMs in the shared VPC networks spaces</li>
<li>Allow network and security admins to create VPNs and firewall rules that are usable by the service projects in the host VPC network</li>
<li>Any security policy applied to the host VPC will automatically be inherited by all the service projects</li>
</ul>

        <pre>Shared VPC allows for the creation of a shared VPC that is named the host VPC, which can share its network of private IP subnets and their attached resources with all the associated projects called service projects. VMs and their application and users can then share the use of the resources in the host VPC, which means that a service project will not even require its own network let alone any dedicated resources.

With shared VPC, you can allow project admins to create VMs in the shared VPC networks spaces and allow network and security admins to create VPNs and firewall rules that are usable by the service projects in the host VPC network. In addition, any security policy applied to the host VPC will automatically be inherited by all the service projects, which makes it easy to apply and enforce consistent policies across a cloud organization.

The diagram shows a host project sharing its VPC network with two service projects. It is sharing Subnet_1 with one project and Subnet_2 with another project.

However, there is another way you can connect two VPC networks regardless of shared projects or organizations using VPC network peering. It allows you to build software as service ecosystems in GCP by making services available privately across different VPC networks in and across organizations.

VPC Network Peering
It's useful for organizations with several network administrative domains that want to peer with other organizations. VPC network peering gives you several advantages over using external IP addresses or VPNs to connect networks, including:
• Reduced network latency - Public IP networking suffers higher latency than private networking.
• Network security - Service owners do not need to have their services exposed to the public internet and deal with its associated risks.
