        <pre>Monitoring and Measuring Failure Scenarios in Google Cloud
=================================================================

Of course we will need to monitor and measure these failure scenarios and it's recommended to perform some load testing especially if you're comparing on-premise to the cloud. AN important aspect to bear in mind when migrating systems from an on-premise network to the cloud is that replacing a physical CPU with, say, eight cores, actually will require a CPU with 16 virtual cores inside of the Google cloud platform.

Understanding hardware architecture is essential and something to bear in mind is that different zones often have different hardware components available. This is due to the diversity of Google's data centres' hardware across the many different technologies. If you go to Compute Engine and click on create VM and then Customize, you can actually choose a CPU platform type.

It is important to give this some considerations as your application may actually benefit from running on a newer instruction set. So you may want to benchmark your application running on each one of these different processor types, to determine which may or may not benefit. You're going to pay the same price but you may well see a surprising difference in your performance benchmarking.

Another thing to consider benchmarking is the OS image that you are running. Google has done a lot of research into this for you and typically Ubuntu runs better over the GCP than other OS versions. But you should either compare Google's published benchmarks or run your own to determine the most optimal for your design.

Regardless of your choice of OS image, you can certainly turn off the OS firewall as Google's firewalls come with the VM instance, and that alone will realize a considerable difference. Additionally, standard persistent disk storage is also crucial to consider when migrating to the cloud.

If you're running something like Windows, which is well known for swapping data to a page file, consider using a local SSD if you can afford it. This is simply because local SSD is much faster than standard hard drives. When considering which persistent disk to use, remember that IOPS are constrained by potential CPU. This means that although you can scale storage, it may have an effect on disk IOPS.

But the interesting thing with Google cloud persistent disk is that the disk IOPS grows as the storage scales. You can see this by looking under Disks in the console and if you choose a standard persistent disk, you get a choice of 10 gigs, and you get a fixed performance. But if you then increase the capacity to 100 gigs, you'll notice that the performance will continue to increase.

Now this is of interest as it's not magic - it's simply because Google has used quotas to enable that larger capacity disk to perform to that higher level. Do keep in mind if you don't have enough CPU to drive the disk I/O, well, then that could potentially be a bottleneck. A rule of thumb when capacity planning is that a higher amount of CPU is necessary to drive larger storage capacity and reap higher disk IOPS.

So also consider I/O bursts, because although the Google network is very, very consistent and almost deterministic in nature, you can still get big spikes, especially if you're flushing data to disk for a database. So remember, if you're trading up for performance over capacity, you need to determine whether you're going to choose the faster SSD over the standard HDs.

        <pre><p><strong>Migrating to Google Cloud: Key Considerations</strong></p>
<p>When migrating systems from an on-premise network to the cloud, it's essential to consider several key factors. <strong>Monitoring and measuring failure scenarios is crucial</strong>, and performing load testing is highly recommended, especially when comparing on-premise to cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Architecture Matters</strong></p>
<p>Replacing a physical CPU with eight cores requires a CPU with 16 virtual cores in the Google Cloud Platform, as every virtual CPU is a single hyper thread. Understanding hardware architecture is vital, as different zones have varying hardware components available due to Google's diverse data centers' technologies.</p>
<p><strong>CPU Platform Type and OS Image</strong></p>
<p>When creating a VM instance, you can choose a CPU platform type, which may benefit your application depending on the instruction set. <strong>Benchmarking your application on each processor type</strong> is recommended to determine the best choice. Additionally, consider the OS image, as Google has researched optimal versions (typically Ubuntu) for GCP. You can also turn off the OS firewall, which alone will realize a significant difference.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Disk Storage</strong></p>
<p>When choosing persistent disk storage, remember that IOPS are constrained by potential CPU. <strong>Google Cloud Persistent Disks' performance grows with capacity</strong>, but ensure you have enough CPU to drive disk I/O. Consider I/O bursts, as big spikes can occur, especially when flushing data to disk for databases.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Planning and Bottlenecks</strong></p>
<p>A higher amount of CPU is necessary to drive larger storage capacity and reap higher disk IOPS. When trading up for performance over capacity, determine whether to choose a faster SSD or standard HDs based on your specific needs.</p>
<p>By considering these key factors, you can ensure a successful migration to the Google Cloud Platform and optimize your infrastructure for optimal performance.</p></pre>
