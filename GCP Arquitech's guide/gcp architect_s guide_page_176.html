        <pre><h1>Cross Regional Load Balancing</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cross regional load balancing is particularly useful if you have users spread out all around the world.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Google Determining User Location</h3>
<p>Having Google determine the location of the user is beneficial in a number of ways but one is that it eliminates the need for a DNS load balancer because utilizing Global Server Load Balancing or GLSB lookups for DNS locations is not always reliable.</p>
<h2>HTTPS Load Balancing</h2>
<p>In this example, we will see how we can use an HTTP load balancer to route traffic between multiple regions and multiple zones. Again, you will use that Anycast single global static IP address to represent your entire frontend application.</p>
<h3>Content-Based Load Balancing</h3>
<p>The Google load balancer can also support content-based load balancing but it only applies to HTTP and HTTPS and it will involve configuring multiple backend services to handle each of the different content types.</p>
<h2>URL Rule Matching</h2>
<p>Basically, it is really more like URL rule matching as it compares the parameters within a URL to pre-configured path rules to each backend service. For example, within a URL it might match against a parameter/video to filter traffic destined for the backend video services and then /static for determining any static content.</p>
<h2>Splitting Traffic</h2>
<p>Now that you have a way to identify, filter and redirect traffic based configure different instance types for different content types in the upon content-type albeit only in the URL you can go ahead and However, to return to the original example, let's say that user traffic is entering through that global HTTP load balancer. Then we are splitting traffic based on the URL header to determine location backend.</p>
<h2>SSL Proxy Load Balancing</h2>
<p>The other types of Global load balancers that we have available to us are the SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancing services. As you might expect, the SSL proxy load balancing performs global load balancing of SSL traffic, routing clients to the closest instance with sufficient capacity.</p>
<h3>Advantages of SSL Proxy</h3>
<p>Some advantages of SSL proxy include intelligent routing, better utilization of the virtual machine instances, certificate management , and security patching.</p>
<h2>TCP Proxy Load Balancing</h2>
<p>The main feature of a SSL proxy is that it terminates the incoming TLS/SSL session, which is the incoming connections arriving at the load balancer from the users. So for example, SSL traffic from users in lowa and Boston will be terminated at the global load balancing layer and a separate SSL connection is then established between the proxy and the selected backend instance.</p>
<p>TCP proxy load balancing also allows you to use a single IP address to present to all users around the world and automatically routes traffic to the instances that are geographically closest to the user. The advantage of using TCP proxy load balancing include, intelligent routing and security patching.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cross regional load balancing is a useful technique for handling traffic from users spread out across different regions. By utilizing Google's global server load balancing, you can eliminate the need for DNS load balancers and route traffic efficiently to backend services.</p></pre>

        <pre>Cross Regional Load Balancing
Now let's learn a little more about cross-regional load balancing. Cross region load balancing is particularly useful if you have users spread out all around the world. By default, Google will route those requests to the closest regions, unless of course you have URL maps and different URL rewrites to determine otherwise.

Having Google determine the location of the user is beneficial in a number of ways but one is that it eliminates the need for a DNS load balancer because utilizing Global Server Load Balancing or GLSB lookups for DNS locations is not always reliable. In direct comparison, with this global load balancer, we don't need to rely on DNS to determine the destination because we can identify where they actually entered the Google network in order to handle that.

HTTPS load balancing
In this example, we will see how we can use an HTTP load balancer to route traffic between multiple regions and multiple zones. Again, you will use that Anycast single global static IP address to represent your entire frontend application.

Earlier we saw how hardware load balancers were adept at handling the balancing or redirection of traffic based on content-type. The Google load balancer can also support content-based load balancing but it only applies to HTTP and HTTPS and it will involve configuring multiple backend services to handle each of the different content types.

Basically, it is really more like URL rule matching as it compares the parameters within a URL to pre-configured path rules to each backend service. For example, within a URL it might match against a parameter/video to filter traffic destined for the backend video services and then /static for determining any static content.

Now that you have a way to identify, filter and redirect traffic based on configure different instance types for different content types in the upon content-type albeit only in the URL you can go ahead and however, to return to the original example, let's say that user traffic is entering through that global HTTP load balancer. Then we are splitting traffic based on the URL header to determine location backend and content-type.

So if they're going to the directory '/video', we can send that to the specific backend video service or if they're just going to the website, we can send them to a general purpose frontend web cluster.

The other types of Global load balancers that we have available to us are the SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancing services. As you might expect, the SSL proxy load balancing performs global load balancing of SSL traffic, routing clients to the closest instance with sufficient capacity.

Some advantages of SSL proxy include intelligent routing, better utilization of the virtual machine instances, certificate management, and security patching. The main feature of a SSL proxy is that it terminates the incoming TLS/SSL session, which is the incoming connections arriving at the load balancer from the users. So for example, SSL traffic from users in lowa and Boston will be terminated at the global load balancing layer and a separate SSL connection is then established between the proxy and the selected backend instance.

TCP proxy load balancing also allows you to use a single IP address to present to all users around the world and automatically routes traffic to the instances that are geographically closest to the user. The advantage of using TCP proxy load balancing includes intelligent routing and security patching.

        <pre><h1>Cross-Regional Load Balancing</h1>
<p>Cross-regional load balancing is particularly useful when users are spread out across the globe. By default, Google will route requests to the closest region unless URL maps and different URL rewrites are used to determine otherwise.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Cross-Regional Load Balancing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eliminates the need for a DNS load balancer by utilizing Global Server Load Balancing (GLSB) lookups for DNS locations.</li>
<li>Allows Google to identify where users entered the network, eliminating the need for reliable DNS-based routing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTTPS Load Balancing</h2>
<p>In this example, we will use an HTTP load balancer to route traffic between multiple regions and zones. We will utilize an Anycast single global static IP address to represent our entire frontend application.</p>
<h2>Content-Based Load Balancing</h2>
<p>The Google load balancer can support content-based load balancing for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This involves configuring multiple backend services to handle different content types. The process is similar to URL rule matching, where parameters within a URL are compared to pre-configured path rules to determine the destination backend service.</p>
<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
<p>Suppose user traffic enters through the global HTTP load balancer. We can split traffic based on the URL header to determine location and content-type. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If users access the directory '/video', we can send them to a specific backend video service.</li>
<li>If users only access the website, we can send them to a general-purpose frontend web cluster.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Global Load Balancers</h2>
<p>Google offers several types of global load balancers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSL Proxy</strong>: Performs global load balancing for SSL traffic, routing clients to the closest instance with sufficient capacity. Advantages include intelligent routing, better utilization of virtual machine instances, certificate management, and security patching.</li>
<li><strong>TCP Proxy</strong>: Allows a single IP address to be presented to all users around the world, automatically routing traffic to instances that are geographically closest to the user. Advantages include intelligent routing and security patching.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, cross-regional load balancing is useful when users are spread out across the globe. The Google load balancer can support content-based load balancing for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, eliminating the need for reliable DNS-based routing. Global load balancers like SSL Proxy and TCP Proxy offer advantages in intelligent routing, security patching, and better utilization of virtual machine instances.</p></pre>
