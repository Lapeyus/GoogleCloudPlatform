        <pre><h1>API Management and Development Environments</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing APIs and development environments is a crucial task in software development. Google Cloud Platform provides two API management tools, Cloud Endpoints and Apigee Edge, to help developers manage their APIs.</p>
<h3>Deprecation and Functional Upgrades</h3>
<p>Developers need to document changes to APIs, including deprecation or functional upgrades, so that clients and other developers know what's happening. This includes documenting new features in version 2 of an API that are not available in version 1.</p>
<h2>Cloud Endpoints</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Cloud Endpoints is a platform for developing and managing API proxies. It implements capabilities such as exposing APIs to trusted developers, monitoring usage, and logging. Cloud Endpoints supports applications running on GCP's compute platforms in various languages and client technologies.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exposing APIs to trusted developers while ensuring security and monitoring.</li>
<li>Implementing features like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Apigee Edge</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Apigee Edge is a platform for developing and managing API proxies with a focus on business problems. It provides capabilities like rate limiting, setting quotas, and providing analytics. However, it requires backend services to be in GCP.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decomposing legacy applications into microservices or micro-apps.</li>
<li>Moving monolith applications to the cloud in a less risky way by peeling off services one by one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development Environments</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Developers need to choose between Google App Engine (GAE) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for building development environments in the cloud. Both provide scalability, redundancy, rollouts, and rollbacks, but differ in management.</p>
<h3>Key Differences</h3>
<ul>
<li>GKE provides fine-grained control over clusters.</li>
<li>GAE manages containers with minimal configuration and management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Managing APIs and development environments is essential for software development. Cloud Endpoints and Apigee Edge provide tools for managing APIs, while GAE and GKE offer platforms for building development environments in the cloud. Developers need to choose the right tool based on their specific needs and requirements.</p></pre>

        <pre>In order to manage and make this transition as clean as possible, developers need to document the changes so that client and other developers know that an API has been depreciated or functionally upgraded. In the latter case, the developers should document that version two of an API contains additional functional calls that version one does not.

This means that applications that consume the API can specify the API version that they want to use in their calls. Managing and supporting an API is a very important task, and Google Cloud Platform provides two API management tools. The first approach is related to issues where you're developing a software service and using one of GCP's backends.

The criteria you would like to meet are that you'd like to make it easy to expose this API but also ensure it's only consumed by other developers whom you trust. Thus, you'd like the API to know which end user is making the service call, in addition to being monitored and usage logged.

Cloud Endpoints
In this scenario, you would use Cloud Endpoints as it implements these capabilities and more using a proxy that is easy to deploy in front of your backend services. It also provides an API console to wrap up those capabilities in an easy-to-manage interface. Cloud Endpoints supports applications running in GCP's compute platforms in your choice of languages and client technologies.

Apigee Edge is another platform for developing and managing API proxies, but it has a different approach as it is primarily focused on business problems such as rate limiting, setting quotas, and providing analytics. However, because the backend services for Apigee Edge need not be in GCP, engineers often use it when decomposing a legacy application into microservices or micro-apps.

It is advantageous and less risky to move a monolith application into the cloud by using Apigee Edge to peel off its services one by one, standing up microservices to implement each in turn until the legacy application can be finally retired.

Use Case - 7
The client likes the idea of building a development environment in the cloud but would like to know which platform to use App Engine or Kubernetes? Solution

The issue here is that both Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google App Engine (GAE) can be the right choice, depending on the degree of control needed. Both provide benefits such as scalability, redundancy, rollouts, and rollbacks, but differ in their management.

GKE gives you fine-grained control over everything about your cluster, while GAE manages containers with minimal configuration or management, restricting control.

        <pre><h3>Managing API Changes and Choosing Cloud Platforms</h3>
<p>To manage and make a transition clean, developers must document changes to clients and other developers, indicating that an API has been deprecated or upgraded. This allows applications consuming the API to specify the desired version.</p>
<p>Managing APIs is crucial, and Google Cloud Platform provides two API management tools: Cloud Endpoints and Apigee Edge. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Endpoints</strong> implements capabilities such as exposing APIs, monitoring usage, and logging, using a proxy that's easy to deploy in front of backend services. It supports applications running on GCP compute platforms in various languages and client technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Apigee Edge</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on business problems like rate limiting, setting quotas, and providing analytics. Although its backend services don't need to be in GCP, engineers often use it when decomposing legacy applications into microservices or micro-apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between App Engine and Kubernetes for a development environment, consider the degree of control needed. Both provide scalability, redundancy, rollouts, and rollbacks but differ in management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</strong> offers fine-grained control over clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Google App Engine (GAE)</strong> manages containers with minimal configuration and management, restricting control.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, developers must document API changes to ensure clients and other developers are aware of deprecations or upgrades. When choosing a cloud platform for development, consider the level of control required and weigh the benefits and limitations of each option.</p></pre>
