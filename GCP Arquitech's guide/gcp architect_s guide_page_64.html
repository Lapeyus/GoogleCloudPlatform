        <pre><h1>Chapter 7 - App Engine</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So far we have discussed two GCP products that provide the compute infrastructure for applications: </p>
<h3>Virtual Machines</h3>
<p>virtual machines for Compute Engine and </p>
<h3>Containers</h3>
<p>containers for Kubernetes Engine.</p>
<p>But perhaps you just want a Platform as a Service so that you can
focus on your application code and not have to concern yourself
with infrastructure. Well that is why there is Google's PaaS, the</p>
<p>Cloud App Engine.</p>
<h2>What is App Engine?</h2>
<p>App Engine is what is known as a platform as a service. In GCP, the
App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking
infrastructure required to run your code. What this means is that
when you want to deploy an application on App Engine, you just
handle the application's code and the App Engine service will give
you access to the platform runtime and libraries of your choice and
provision and manage the infrastructure on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Built-in Services</h2>
<p>To accomplish this, App Engine provides you with the built-in
services that many web applications require by default, such as:
* a NoSQL database
* in-memory caching
* load balancing
* health checks
* logging
* a way to authenticate users</p>
<p>But there are no servers for you to provision or maintain as everything is handled transparently within App Engine.</p>
<h2>Concept and Scaling</h2>
<p>The concept behind App Engine is that you code your application to
take advantage of 
these services and App Engine will provide them
for you. Moreover, App 
Engine will automatically scale your
application's 
resources in response to the demand and amount 
of traffic but you will only 
pay for those resources that you use.</p>
<h2>Environments</h2>
<p>App Engine offers two choices of environments, standard and flexible.
Of the two App Engine Environments, Standard is 
the simpler. It offers a simpler deployment experience than the Flexible environment.</p>
<p>However the most notable difference is that with the Standard Environment your low utilization applications might be able to run at no charge as it offers a free daily usage quota for the use of some services.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>In order to assist in the deployment of code to the cloud App Engine Google provides an App Engine SDK. These are available in several languages and provide you with simple commands for deployment and an environment for testing your application locally before you upload it to the GCP's App Engine service.</p>
<h2>Runtime Environment</h2>
<p>Now, what often intrigues people is the question of what does the application code actually run on?
App Engine Standard Environment
The short answer to that is it runs in App Engine on an executable binary called a runtime.
In App Engine Standard Environment, you use a runtime provided by Google. Also the Standard Environment provides runtimes for specific versions of Java, Python, PHP and Go. As well as the libraries that supports all the App Engine APIs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>App Engine is a powerful platform as a service that can help you focus on your application code while automating the infrastructure management. By understanding how it works and its features, you can build scalable and efficient applications with ease.</p></pre>

        <pre>Chapter 7 - App Engine

So far we have discussed two GCP products that provide the compute infrastructure for applications: virtual machines for Compute Engine and containers for Kubernetes Engine. But perhaps you just want a Platform as a Service so that you can focus on your application code and not have to concern yourself with infrastructure. Well, that is why there is Google's PaaS, the Cloud App Engine.

App Engine is what is known as a platform as a service. In GCP, the App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your code. What this means is that when you want to deploy an application on App Engine, you just handle the application's code and the App Engine service will give you access to the platform runtime and libraries of your choice and provision and manage the infrastructure on your behalf.

But there are no servers for you to provision or maintain as everything is handled transparently within App Engine.

The concept behind App Engine is that you code your application to take advantage of these services and App Engine will provide them for you. Moreover, App Engine will automatically scale your application's resources in response to the demand and amount of traffic but you will only pay for those resources that you use. The billing model and the automated and elastic scaling is why App Engine is especially suited for variable workloads or unpredictable applications such as web and mobile backends.

App Engine offers two choices of environments, standard and flexible. Of the two App Engine Environments, Standard is the simpler. It offers a simpler deployment experience than the Flexible environment. However, the most notable difference is that with the Standard Environment your low utilization applications might be able to run at no charge as it offers a free daily usage quota for the use of some services.

In order to assist in the deployment of code to the cloud App Engine, Google provides an App Engine SDK. These are available in several languages and provide you with simple commands for deployment and an environment for testing your application locally before you upload it to the GCP's App Engine service.

Now, what often intrigues people is the question of what does the application code actually run on?

App Engine Standard Environment

The short answer to that is it runs in App Engine on an executable binary called a runtime. In App Engine Standard Environment, you use a runtime provided by Google. Also, the Standard Environment provides runtimes for specific versions of Java, Python, PHP, and Go. As well as the libraries that support all the App Engine APIs.

App Engine Flexible Environment

The flexible environment offers more advanced features than the standard environment. It allows you to deploy your application in a containerized environment, which can be beneficial for applications with complex dependencies or those that require specific configurations. However, this also means that you will need to manage the infrastructure and configuration of your application yourself.

App Engine SDK

The App Engine SDK is an essential tool for deploying code to the cloud App Engine service. It provides simple commands for deployment and an environment for testing your application locally before you upload it to the GCP's App Engine service. The SDK is available in several languages, including Java, Python, PHP, and Go.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Cloud App Engine is a powerful platform as a Service that allows you to focus on your application code while letting the App Engine service handle the infrastructure and configuration for you. With its built-in services, automated scaling, and flexible environment options, App Engine is an ideal choice for variable workloads or unpredictable applications such as web and mobile backends.
