<h2>Google Cloud Platform Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Why cloud pricing is important?
Google cloud platform has a number of built mechanisms to help you in keeping on top of costs, one of the most notable  is virtual machine dimensioning.

<h3>Customizing VMs</h3>
<p>Typically users will pick a standard  template for a VM but you can use custom VM that you  optimize for high memory or for more CPUs.
But some  special purpose VM may need things like GPUs or TPUS for machine learning  purposes.
Hence VMs may be customized to match your workload but of course then they would not match  any standard machine type discount.</p>
<h3>Inferred Type Discounts</h3>
<p>Google though has provided a work  around for this anomaly via the inferred type discount.
The way this work is that Google will calculate how often and for how many hours you've used a particular type of VM.
Then they will try to  match it to a similar standard lower cost configurations and give you a discount at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Committed Use Discounts</h3>
<p>There is also committed use discounts, which are a pre-pay model

Therefore you can use any configuration it doesn't matter so long  as you meet your obligations on core use you will get a  fixed discount  for  anywhere from one year to three years depending  on how  much you'll  commit to.</p>
<h3>Pre-emptible VMs</h3>
<p>Another interesting  way to  lower costs is  to use pre- emptible VMs.
In  case you don't know a pre-emptible VM is one that  you allow  GCP to terminate if they  require the  resources during peak demand  and they are  shutdown with 30 second  notification.
Furthermore , the  VM is guaranteed to be terminated  within  24 hours if  you're not preempted.
That doesn't sound very attractive so  they give you an 80% discount to encourage you to use them.</p>
<h3>Pre-emptible VMs in High Availability</h3>
<p>The  thing is though  sometimes pre-emptive VMs  are very attractive because  they can fit in nicely  into  your design and save you money.

In For example  if you are building a highly available environment this case you  might as well use the pre-emptive VMs as not only will you get the 80 % discount but you will also have an inbuilt continuous  fail-over test environment.</p>

<p>When it comes to pricing for storage it is really driven by whether you are chasing performance  or  capacity.

Why cloud pricing is important?

Google Cloud Platform has a number of built mechanisms to help you keep on top of costs. One of the most notable features is virtual machine dimensioning. We have already mentioned the standard machine type discount, but GCP also offers inferred type discounts, sustained-use discounts, and there are inferred instance discounts.

Typically users will pick a standard template for a VM, but you can use custom VMs that you optimize for high memory or more CPUs. Some special purpose VMs may need things like GPUs or TPUS for machine learning purposes. Hence VMs may be customized to match your workload, but they would not match any standard machine type discount.

Google has provided a workaround for this anomaly via the inferred type discount. The way it works is that Google will calculate how often and for how many hours you've used a particular type of VM. Then they will try to match it to a similar standard lower cost configurations and give you a discount at the end of the year.

There is also committed use discounts, which are a pre-pay model where you commit use as Flex, Dataproc, so on and so forth. Periodically, you can use any configuration that doesn't matter, as long as you meet your obligations on core use, you will get a fixed discount for anywhere from one year to three years depending on how much you'll commit to.

Unfortunately, this discount does not apply to Google managed services such as App Engine and App Engine. Another interesting way to lower costs is to use pre-emptible VMs. In case you don't know, a pre-emptible VM is one that allows GCP to terminate if they require the resources during peak demand and are shutdown with 30-second notification.

Furthermore, the VM is guaranteed to be terminated within 24 hours if you're not preempted. That doesn't sound very attractive, so they give you an 80% discount to encourage you to use them. The thing is though, sometimes pre-emptive VMs are very attractive because they can fit in nicely into your design and save you money.

You've already built in the ability for fault-tolerance and failover. In case of building a highly available environment, this might as well be used, not only will you get the 80% discount but also have an inbuilt continuous fail-over test environment.

So, what about optimizing disk costs? When it comes to pricing for storage, it is really driven by whether you are chasing performance or capacity. This is another trade-off, as high-performance SSD is certainly more expensive as it costs more per gig (capacity), but it's a much lower price for IOPS (performance).

Trying to find a balance that matches your budget is typically driven more by the technical capacity/performance demands of the design and the system properties more than the pricing. However, you can make savings here when neither is critical.

        <pre><p><strong>Pricing in Google Cloud Platform: A Key Consideration for Reliability and Cost Optimization</strong></p>
<p>When designing a solution on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it's essential to consider the cost implications of reliability measures. Distributing elements of your solution across multiple regions can improve reliability, but this design might result in additional network charges for egress traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing Mechanisms in GCP</strong></p>
<p>To help users manage costs, GCP offers several pricing mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual Machine Dimensioning</strong>: This feature allows users to optimize their virtual machine (VM) configurations for high memory or more CPUs. However, custom VMs may not be eligible for standard machine type discounts.</li>
<li><strong>Inferred Type Discounts</strong>: GCP calculates the usage of a particular VM type and matches it with similar standard lower-cost configurations to provide a discount at the end of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Committed Use Discounts</strong>: This pre-pay model allows users to commit to a certain amount of core use, resulting in a fixed discount for a specified period (1-3 years). However, this discount does not apply to Google managed services like App Engine.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-emptible VMs</strong>: These VMs are terminated if they require resources during peak demand and are shut down with 30-second notification. Users receive an 80% discount to encourage their use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optimizing Disk Costs</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to pricing for storage, the primary consideration is whether users are chasing performance or capacity. High-performance SSDs are more expensive per gig but offer lower prices for IOPS (performance). To find a balance that matches your budget, consider the technical capacity/performance demands of your design and system properties.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Reliability and Cost</strong></p>
<p>In highly available environments, pre-emptible VMs can be an attractive option due to their built-in fault-tolerance and failover capabilities. These VMs not only offer an 80% discount but also provide a continuous fail-over test environment. By carefully evaluating the trade-offs between reliability and cost, users can optimize their GCP solutions for maximum efficiency.</p></pre>
