        <pre><h1>Persistent External Disk Types</h1>
<h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
<p>When building a VM, you must select a persistent external disk type. This choice determines whether your data will be stored on a spinning hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD).</p>
<h3>Persistent vs Non-Persistent Disks</h3>
<p>Persistent disks are durable network storage devices that distribute data across several physical disks. They can survive even if the VM terminates, but they cannot be moved between regions.</p>
<h4>Persistent HDD vs SSD</h4>
<p>Standard persistent disks use standard spinning hard disk drives (HDD), while SSD persistent disks use solid-state drives (SSD). The main difference is that HDDs are more efficient and cost-effective for typical sequential read/write operations, while SSDs handle high rates of random input/output operations per second (IOPS) and offer extremely low millisecond latency.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Disk Type</h3>
<p>The choice between persistent HDD and SSD depends on your specific needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use HDD persistent disks for applications that require efficient sequential read/write operations.</li>
<li>Use SSD persistent disks for applications that require high rates of random I/O operations or extremely low latency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Considerations</h2>
<p>When selecting a persistent external disk type, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent disks are dynamically resizable while running and attached to a VM.</li>
<li>You can attach and share disks in read-only mode to multiple VMs.</li>
<li>Persistent disks cannot be moved between regions; you must take a snapshot of your data before moving it to a new region.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Local SSDs vs Persistent Disks</h2>
<p>Local SSDs are fundamentally different from persistent disks, as they are physically attached to the virtual machine. This means that local SSDs offer even lower latency and higher IOPS than persistent disks.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When building a VM, selecting the right persistent external disk type is crucial for ensuring data availability and performance. By understanding the differences between HDD and SSD persistent disks, you can choose the best option for your specific needs.</p></pre>
      </div>
      <div id="txt" class="tab">

        <pre>Therefore, you must select a persistent external disk type. The result is an interesting condition where you can terminate or delete the VM instance but retain its boot disk and data. To have a boot disk survive a VM deletion, the "Delete boot disk when instance is deleted" box needs to be cleared in the instances property.

There are different types of disks and you should understand the difference as some are persistent and some are not. The first disk that we create is what we call an external persistent disk, this is where we will store and boot the OS image. What 'external' means is it not integrated within the VM it is going to be attached to the VM through the network interface. Its 'persistent' because the drive is not physically attached to the VM and neither is its data; they are independent of one another.

This separation of disk and VM allows the disk to survive if the VM terminates. But we must not confuse a disk with a physical object; it is after all virtual storage. This delivers some handy features such as persistent disks being dynamically resizable even while they're running and attached to a VM. Also, you can attach and share a disk in read-only mode to multiple VMs. This lets you share static data between multiple instances which is much cheaper than replicating your data to unique disks for individual instances.

However, there is a drawback as persistent disks are bounded to their region and they can't be moved between regions. This is why if you move a VM across regions, you need to first take a snapshot of the data and then copy it onto the new disk that you create in the destination region's zone.

The choice that you have of disk storage when building your VM is between persistent HDD and persistent SSD disk, and this choice will be determined by cost or performance. By their nature, persistent disks are durable network storage devices as the data is distributed across several physical disks. It is Compute Engine's responsibility to manage the data distribution and to ensure redundancy and optimize performance for you.

Indeed, you need not concern yourself with most disk management tasks such as disk partitioning, redundant disk arrays, or sub-volume management. However, to get the best performance, simply format your persistent disks with a single file system and no partition tables. However, if you need to separate your data into multiple unique volumes, then you should add more disks rather than create multiple partitions on the existing drives.

Standard persistent disks are basically standard spinning hard disk drives (HDD) whereas SSD persistent disks are solid-state drives (SSD). The differentiator between these two disk types is that the standard HDD persistent disks compared against the SSD are more efficient and cost-effective when handling typical sequential read/write operations. However, SSD drives are designed to handle high rates of random input/output operations per second (IOPS).

Thus, if your applications require very high rates of random IOPS, then you should use SSD persistent disks. This is also because SSD persistent disks are designed for extremely low millisecond latency in the single-digits.

Now, there is another type of disk storage called local SSDs but these are fundamentally different from persistent disks in that they're physically attached to the virtual machine.
