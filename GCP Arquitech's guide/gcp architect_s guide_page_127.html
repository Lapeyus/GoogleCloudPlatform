        <pre><h1>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Memberships</h1>
<h2>Types of Memberships</h2>
<h3>1. Google Groups</h3>
<p>You can easily add members to and remove members from a Google group instead of updating a cloud IM policy to add or remove users.</p>
<h3>2. Service Accounts</h3>
<p>A service account is a type of account that belongs to your service or application, used in automation scenarios where you want the application to interact with a resource without human intervention.</p>
<h2>Service Account Types</h2>
<p>There are three types of service accounts:
- <strong>User Creator/Custom</strong>: More flexibility than the default service account but require more management.
- <strong>Built-in</strong>: The built-in Compute Engine default service account and the Google Cloud platform API service account, which is automatically granted the editor role on the project.
- <strong>Google APIs Service Account</strong></p>
<h2>Built-in Service Accounts</h2>
<p>All projects have the built-in Compute Engine default service account and the Google Cloud platform API service account.</p>
<h3>1. Default Service Account</h3>
<p>The default account is automatically created for every project and is identifiable by the email <code>projectnumber@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com</code>.</p>
<h3>2. Custom Service Account</h3>
<p>You can start an instance with a custom service account, providing more flexibility than the default service account but requiring more management.</p>
<h2>Access Scopes</h2>
<p>Authorization is the process of determining what permissions and privileges an authenticated identity has on a set of specified resources. Scopes are the mechanisms used to determine if an authenticated identity is authorized.</p>
<h3>1. Adding Members to Google Groups</h3>
<p>You can easily add members to and remove members from a Google group instead of updating a cloud IM policy to add or remove users.</p>
<h3>2. Authorization Process</h3>
<p>The authorization process determines what permissions and privileges an authenticated identity has on a set of specified resources.</p>
<h2>Accessing Cloud Resources with Service Accounts</h2>
<p>To access cloud resources, you need to authenticate using a service account. You can enable the service account on a VM instance and grant read/write access to obtain credentials from the service account.</p>
<h3>1. Enabling Service Accounts</h3>
<p>You can enable a custom service account on a VM instance or disable service accounts for that VM instance.</p>
<h3>2. Obtaining Credentials from Service Account</h3>
<p>To authenticate to cloud resources, you need to obtain credentials from the service account using the <code>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</code> environment variable.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) memberships are essential for managing access to cloud resources. Understanding the different types of memberships and how to use them effectively is crucial for securing your applications and data.</p></pre>

        <pre>You can also easily add members to and remove members from a Google group instead of updating a cloud IM policy to add or remove users.

Importantly, GCP does not create or manage users or groups as that is the task of the G Suite Admin, which manages users and groups for an organization in a separate product from GCP.

Service Account
As we mentioned earlier, another type of member that you can have in GCP is a service account. This is a type of account that belongs to your service or application, and is used in typically automation scenarios where you want the application to interact with a resource without any human intervention. Hence you will need the application or the service to have an identity instead of an end user.

A service account provides an identity for a service that is responsible for executing a server-to-server interaction within a project. The issue here is how service accounts manage this without supplying hardcoded user credentials. For example, if you write an application that reads and writes files on cloud storage, it must first authenticate to either the Google Cloud Storage, via an XML API or JSON API.

Now with GCP you can enable service accounts and grant read/write access to the account on the VM instance where you plan to run your application. Then, the next step will be to code the application to obtain credentials from the service account. In this way your application can then authenticate to the storage API without embedding any secrets or credentials with-in the VM instance, image, or application code.

There are three types of service accounts: user creator or custom, built-in, and Google APIs service accounts. All projects have the built-in Compute Engine default service account. In addition, all projects come with a Google Cloud platform API service account, identifiable by the email projectnumber@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com. This service account is designed to run internal Google processes, and it is automatically granted the editor role on the project.

The default account is automatically created for every project. Also, this account is identifiable by the email projectnumber-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com, and it is automatically granted the editor role on the project. Moreover, you can start an instance with a custom service account. This provides more flexibility than the default service account, but they do require more management. You can make as many custom service accounts as you require and assign them to any Cloud IAM role, arbitrary access scopes, or any virtual machine instance.

When you start a new instance using gcloud, the default service account is enabled on that instance. However, you can prevent this by specifying another service account, or by disabling service accounts for that VM instance.

Access Scopes
Authorization is the process of determining what permissions and privileges an authenticated identity has on a set of specified resources. Scopes are the mechanisms used to determine, if an authenticated identity is authorized.
