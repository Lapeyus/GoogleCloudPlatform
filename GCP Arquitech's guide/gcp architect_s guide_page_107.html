<h3>Compute Engine VM</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>In GCP when it comes to compute and processing options the most commonly used is the traditional virtual machine instance. This is typically because Compute Engine gives you the utmost in flexibility when making a VM instance.

<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>You get a VM and an operating system, and it's up to you to manage it and handle aspects such as auto-scaling and firewall rules.</li>
<li>The primary work-case of Compute Engine is pretty much any general workload, especially enterprise applications that were designed to run on a server infrastructure. This makes Compute Engine very portable and easy to run in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Types and Configurations</h4>
<p>Earlier you learned that when using Compute Engine to make a type, the former offers you a selection of commonly used models, new VM instance you can use either predefined or custom machine. The latter allows you to choose how much memory and how much CPU you want. You can also select the type and capacity of disk you require, such as standard hard drives, SSDs, or local SSDs.</p>
<p>You can even configure the networking as well as run a combination of Linux Windows machines.</p>
<h4>Customizing the VM</h4>

Chapter 13 - VMs in Compute Engine deep-dive

In this chapter, we will take a deeper dive into some of the core services that we introduced in Part 1, which provided you with a high-level introduction to Google Cloud Platform. The first core service that we will examine in far more detail than previously is Compute Engine's VMs.

Compute Engine VM
In GCP when it comes to compute and processing options, the most commonly used is the traditional virtual machine instance. This is typically because Compute Engine gives you the utmost in flexibility when making a VM instance. For example, you are free to run whatever OS or language that you want as this is a pure IaaS - infrastructure as a service - model.

With laaS, you get a VM and an operating system, and it's up to you to manage it and handle aspects such as auto-scaling and firewall rules. The primary work-case of Compute Engine is pretty much any general workload, especially enterprise applications that were designed to run on a server infrastructure. This makes Compute Engine very portable and easy to run in the cloud.

Earlier you learned that when using Compute Engine to make a type, the former offers you a selection of commonly used models, new VM instance you can use either predefined or custom machine. The latter allows you to choose how much memory and how much CPU you want. You can also select the type and capacity of disk you require, such as standard hard drives, SSDs, or local SSDs. You can even configure the networking as well as run a combination of Linux and Windows machines.

In this chapter, now that we understand more about security, networking, and load balancing, we're going to cover several of the other features that we can configure differently, including availability policies, pricing options, and usage discounts, such as start-up scripts, machine rightsizing, firewall rules, and customizing the VM.

Customizing the VM
A good starting point when discussing VMs is to consider how many CPUs you will require. To this end, Compute Engine provides a large selection of predetermined machine configurations that would be suitable for most use cases. Specifically, there are predefined micro, medium, or high CPU, low to high memory, and standard and shared-core machine types.

But importantly, should those machine types not be suitable, you can also customize your own machine.

        <pre><h3>Compute Engine's VMs: A Deep Dive</h3>
<h4>Overview of Virtual Machine Instances</h4>
<p>In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the traditional virtual machine instance is the most commonly used compute and processing option. This is due to Compute Engine's flexibility in creating a VM instance, allowing users to run any OS or language they choose.</p>
<h4>Pure IaaS Model</h4>
<p>Compute Engine operates on a pure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, where users receive a VM and an operating system, with full control over management aspects such as auto-scaling and firewall rules.</p>
<h4>Primary Workload</h4>
<p>The primary workload of Compute Engine is general workloads, especially enterprise applications designed for server infrastructure. This makes it portable and easy to run in the cloud.</p>
<h4>Predefined vs. Custom Machine Types</h4>
<p>When creating a VM instance, users can choose from predefined or custom machine types. The latter allows users to select memory, CPU, disk type, and networking configuration, as well as run a combination of Linux and Windows machines.</p>
<h4>Features for Configuration</h4>
<p>In addition to security, networking, and load balancing, Compute Engine offers features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability policies</li>
<li>Pricing options</li>
<li>Usage discounts (e.g., start-up scripts, machine rightsizing, firewall rules)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Customizing the VM</h3>
<p>When discussing VMs, it's essential to consider CPU requirements. Compute Engine provides a range of predetermined machine configurations suitable for most use cases, including micro, medium, high CPU, low to high memory, and standard and shared-core machine types.</p>
<p>However, if these machine types are not suitable, users can customize their own machine by selecting specific parameters such as CPU, memory, disk type, and networking configuration.</p></pre>

<h3>Topic 2: Flexibility in VM Configuration</h3>
<p>This topic highlights the flexibility in configuring VMs, including selecting from predefined models or customizing machine configurations to choose memory, CPU, disk type, and networking settings.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Security, Networking, and Load Balancing</h3>
<p>Although not a primary focus of this chapter, security, networking, and load balancing are mentioned as related topics that will be covered in future chapters. This topic is more about setting the stage for discussing these features rather than delving into them deeply.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Customizing VMs</h3>
<p>This topic emphasizes the importance of considering CPU requirements when selecting a VM configuration. It also discusses how Compute Engine provides predefined machine configurations but allows users to customize their own machines if needed.</p>
<h3>Topic 5: Availability Policies and Pricing Options</h3>
