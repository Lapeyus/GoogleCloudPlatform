        <pre><h1>Load Balancing in GCP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Load balancing is a crucial component of a scalable and reliable application architecture. In this section, we'll explore the different aspects of load balancing in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>
<h3>Backend Services vs Target Pools</h3>
<p>A backend service is conceptually similar to a target pool, but with additional health checks to determine when to send traffic to that pool.</p>
<h2>Regional Redundancy</h2>
<p>The global internet and cloud infrastructure require regional redundancy. We don't want to send all traffic to one region by default. Instead, we need to have alternative regions to redirect requests to in case the primary region is overloaded.</p>
<h3>Health Checks</h3>
<p>We can deploy different health checks to ensure that our application continues to function even if one of the backend services fails. This includes metrics such as CPU utilization, maximum request per second per instance, and more.</p>
<h2>Session Affinity</h2>
<p>To maintain session affinity, we use techniques such as basic client IP affinity or generated cookie affinity. Basic client IP affinity directs requests from the same origin IP address to the same server, while generated cookie affinity issues a cookie on the user's first visit and directs subsequent requests to the same instance.</p>
<h3>Issues with Session Affinity</h3>
<p>However, session affinity can break due to various reasons such as instance group capacity running out, auto scaling changes, or target instances failing health checks. We need to understand these conditions and criteria to determine when to divert traffic to another backend.</p>
<h2>Balancer Mode</h2>
<p>The balancer mode setting allows us to select one of several metrics to determine whether the backend instance group is at capacity. This includes CPU utilization, maximum request per second per instance, maximum request per second per group, and more. The choice of metric depends on how well it matches the operational dynamics of our application.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Load balancing in GCP requires a deep understanding of regional redundancy, health checks, session affinity, and balancer mode settings. By deploying the right combination of these components, we can ensure that our applications are scalable, reliable, and performant.</p></pre>

        <pre>For example, if the URL is for a specific content page then we can send the user to the relevant web server, if it is for a download we can redirect the user directly to the download service page. If it is for an upload we can similarly redirect the user to the appropriate service page they require. Therefore, we will typically want to refine which backend services can best handle which target URL.

A backend service is conceptually similar to a target pool, the difference being that here we're going to configure some additional health checks to determine the conditions under which we will send traffic to that pool.

After all this is the global internet and the cloud so we don't just want to be sending all traffic to one region by default. For example, we don't want to just send all traffic to Seoul, on the basis that most of the users are in Asia. We need to have some regional redundancy so that if the Korean instance group is overloaded and we've maxed out the number of servers that we're going to scale too, we have an alternative region to redirect requests to that can service our requests.

Now let us consider the different health checks that we might want to deploy that would ensure we were able to continue forwarding traffic for our application. Since we have the option to route traffic to completely different regions, we might even want out health check to instigate a fail-over mechanism. So for example, if we are experiencing high latency in Korea, we could route traffic to another region within Southeast Asia.

Regardless of the region or backends we choose to send our traffic too we must ensure it is handled in a consistent manner. To accomplish this we use Session Affinity, which we can configure so that requests from the same client go to the same instance and thereby maintain their current session.

With basic client IP affinity this directs requests from the same origin IP address to the same server. However, there are issues with IP Affinity due to Network Proxies and Network Address Translation (NAT), which can cause requests from multiple different users to look like they come from the same address. This confuses some IP affinity methods and so many users will get routed to the same instance.

On the other hand, there is the other extreme whereby a user who moves between networks may be seen as two completely different users and not be directed to the same instance all of the time. To solve these issues you can use within GCP a technique called Generated Cookie Affinity. This method causes the load balancer to issue a cookie named GCLB on the user's first visit or request, and then it directs subsequent requests with the same cookie to the same instance.

Despite all of these good intentions to maintain session affinity we have to be realistic and accept that session affinity can break. If for example an instance group runs out of capacity and traffic is routed to another zone, or if auto scaling changes the resource capacity and load is reallocated, or if the target instance fails health checks. Consequently, we will need to understand the conditions and criteria that would determine the need to divert traffic to another backend.

The load balancer and the capacity-scaler will track and react to the designated maximum utilization thresholds set for a backend. The balancer-mode is a setting that lets you select one of the following metrics to determine whether the backend instance group is at capacity; CPU utilization, maximum request per second per instance, maximum request per second per group and CPU utilization and rate. Which one you choose will be down to how best they match the operational dynamics of your application.

        <pre><p><strong>Configuring Load Balancing for Consistent Application Performance</strong></p>
<p>To ensure consistent performance across different regions and backend services, we need to refine which backend services can handle specific target URLs. A backend service is similar to a target pool but with additional health checks to determine when to send traffic.</p>
<p>We must also consider regional redundancy to avoid overloading instance groups in one region. This means having alternative regions to redirect requests to if the primary region becomes overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Health Checks and Fail-Over Mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>To ensure continuous forwarding of traffic, we can deploy health checks that instigate fail-over mechanisms. For example, if high latency is experienced in Korea, we can route traffic to another region within Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Regardless of the region or backend services used, it's essential to maintain session affinity by directing requests from the same client to the same instance. However, basic client IP affinity has limitations due to Network Proxies and Network Address Translation (NAT), which can cause multiple users to be routed to the same instance.</p>
<p>To overcome these issues, we can use Generated Cookie Affinity, which issues a cookie named GCLB on the user's first visit or request and directs subsequent requests with the same cookie to the same instance.</p>
<p><strong>Session Affinity and Breakage</strong></p>
<p>Despite our best intentions, session affinity can break due to various reasons such as instance group capacity, auto-scaling changes, or target instance health checks. Therefore, we need to understand the conditions and criteria that determine the need to divert traffic to another backend.</p>
<p>The load balancer and capacity scaler track designated maximum utilization thresholds for backends and react accordingly. We can select metrics such as CPU utilization, maximum requests per second, or CPU utilization and rate to determine when a backend instance group is at capacity.</p></pre>
