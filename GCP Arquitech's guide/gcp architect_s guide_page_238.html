        <pre>Correlated Failures and Failure due to Overload

Correlated failures occur when a single event causes a chain reaction of failures. For example, if a zone or region is lost, all resources in it will inevitably fail. This is known as a failure domain. To identify potential failure domains during the design process, divide business logic into services based on failure domains. This approach considers resiliency for entire failure domains rather than individual components.

Dividing business logic into services based on failure domains makes it easier to look at the problem from a high-level perspective, such as identifying failure domains at the zone or regional level. The goal is to separate and isolate the risk of correlated failures while designing independent but collaborative services.

Failure due to Overload

When a system is overloaded, it will exhibit nonlinear behavior, such as local applications hanging, crashing, disks thrashing, or stopping altogether. Overloading occurs for several reasons, but a common cause is the relationship between failure due to loss and failure due to overload.

For instance, if a system goes offline due to the loss of a downstream resource, it becomes unavailable to upstream systems that depend on it. When the system comes back online, the queued backlog of work must be processed before new work can be handled. This may overwhelm the system, causing it to transition from being unavailable due to resource loss to being unavailable due to overload.

Common behaviors of failure due to overload include running out of memory, high CPU usage, or disk thrashing. Regardless of the symptoms, unavailability will create a chain reaction of effects, leading to failures in dependent services. To identify potential points of overload, take an overall look at the networking service architecture.

This is because once there's overload on a resource, such as an overloaded frontend, a large list of cascading failures will occur. Troubleshooting can be challenging when dealing with multiple independent alarms being triggered. Therefore, it's essential to identify in the design process what are the critical first things that can happen, which indicate an overload.

        <pre><h3>Correlated Failures and Failure due to Overload</h3>
<p>Correlated failures occur when a single event causes a chain reaction of failures. This can happen when a zone or region is lost, resulting in all resources failing. To mitigate this, it's essential to identify potential failure domains during the design process.</p>
<p>Best practices include dividing business logic into services based on failure domains, allowing for resiliency across entire failure domains rather than individual components. This approach enables a high-level perspective, such as identifying failure domains at the zone or regional level.</p>
<h3>Failure due to Overload</h3>
<p>When a system is overloaded, it will exhibit nonlinear behavior, leading to applications hanging, crashing, disks thrashing, or stopping altogether. Overloading can occur due to various reasons, but a common cause is the relationship between loss and overload failures.</p>
<p>When a system comes back online after being offline due to resource loss, the queued backlog of work must be processed before new work can be handled. This may overwhelm the system, causing it to transition from total unavailability due to resource loss to total unavailability due to overload.</p>
<p>Common behaviors of failure due to overload include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running out of memory or disk space</li>
<li>Disk thrashing</li>
<li>No network availability</li>
<li>CPU being too busy</li>
</ul>
<p>To identify potential points of overload, it's crucial to take an overall look at the networking service architecture. However, this can be challenging when dealing with multiple independent alarms triggered simultaneously.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's essential to identify the most critical events that indicate an overload during the design process.</p></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>What is a failure domain, and how does it relate to correlated failures?
Answer: A failure domain refers to a situation where something fails and causes a huge chain of events, resulting in the inevitable failure of all resources within that zone or region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it essential to identify potential failure domains during the design process?
Answer: Identifying potential failure domains helps designers separate and isolate the risk of correlated failures, while designing independent but collaborative services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when a system experiences overload, and how does it affect dependent systems?
Answer: When a system experiences overload, it exhibits nonlinear behavior, such as applications hanging or crashing, and can cause a huge chain of effects that lead to the failure of all dependent services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do correlated failures differ from failure due to overload?
Answer: Correlated failures occur when something fails and causes a huge chain of events, whereas failure due to overload occurs when a system becomes overwhelmed, leading to nonlinear behavior and potential cascading failures.</p>
