        <pre>**Google App Engine**

**Cons**

App Engine manages the infrastructure for you, making it a low-maintenance platform. It also handles auto-scaling on your behalf and is fast and lightweight due to its instance classes. Additional functions such as version management and traffic splitting are built into both standard and flexible environments. Native access to Datastore is available, with co-location in the App Engine Standard environment. There's also built-in access to Memcache.

The secure sandbox in the standard environment provides a more secure way of working compared to Compute Engine, where you need to handle security controls yourself. However, this sandbox prevents interaction with file systems and persistent storage, keeping instances smaller for faster autoscaling.

There is no networking support in the standard edition's sandbox.

**Pros**

App Engine Flex supports custom runtimes and integrates with GCE networking. Built-in version and traffic management are also available.

However, App Engine has limited support for Cloud Load Balancer and only supports specific runtimes: Python 2.7, Java 7 and 8, Go 1.6-1.9, and PHP 5.5.

**Google Kubernetes Engine**

**Pros**

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) natively integrates with containers, allowing for custom runtimes. It also provides tight coupling with containers for better management and cluster configuration.

However, GKE enforces best practices for virtual machines, making it easy to roll back VMs to previous versions. Containers provide a flexible and platform-neutral deployment framework, and open-source Kubernetes offers portability between on-premises and the cloud.

Private Clusters are now in beta, eliminating the need to expose public IP addresses. Version management is handled through Google Container Registry.

**Cons**

GKE has no native traffic management, which can be a drawback. There's also some management overhead due to its complexity. The platform requires a learning curve due to many new concepts such as pods, deployments, services, ingress, and namespaces.

Public IPs need to be exposed in locations where you want to run 'kubectl' commands. Monitoring tool integration is limited, which can make it harder to manage your cluster effectively.
