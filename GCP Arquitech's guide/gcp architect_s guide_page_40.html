        <pre><h1>Virtual Machines in GCP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When choosing a virtual machine (VM) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), there are several factors to consider. This document will outline some key considerations for setting up and managing your VM.</p>
<h3>Fast Disk Storage</h3>
<p>However, there is another type of disk storage that is very fast and should you have a requirement in your application for very high performance scratch space, you may want to attach a local SSD. However, a local SSD is part of the VM so be sure to store data of any permanent value somewhere else because local SSD's content doesn't survive when the VM terminates.</p>
<h3>Backups</h3>
<p>Another convenient aspect of VM is taking backups. Once your VMs are running it is easy to take a durable snapshot of their disks. These are useful as backups but they also are required when you need to move a VM to another region.</p>
<h2>Pre-emptive VMs</h2>
<p>Pre-emptive</p>
<p>Another factor you might want to consider is if you want to make your VM pre-emptible. You can save a lot of money if you choose to use pre-emptible VMs where they are appropriate. However pre-emptible VM are only suitable in certain use-cases as they behave differently from ordinary VMs.</p>
<h3>Auto-scaling</h3>
<p>Auto-scaling is another factor to consider because despite the fact you can create huge VMs - the maximum number of virtual CPUs in the VM is 96 and the maximum memory size in beta is at 624 gigabytes - and these huge VMs are great for workloads like in- memory databases and CPU intensive analytics but you may not want to start off at that size.</p>
<p>For example, most GCP customers start off by scaling out, not scaling up. What that means is they add more standard sized VMs to loadbalance across, this is called horizontal scaling, rather than increasing the size of their existing VMs, which is known as vertical scaling.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Boot Image</h2>
<p>The next step is that you choose a boot image. As we have discussed already GCP offers a wide selection of Linux and Windows versions that are pre-configured but if you want you can import your own images.</p>
<p>Indeed, a common request made by GCP customers is that they want their VMs to always boot with a specific configuration, such as installing specific updates or packages at boot time. Therefore it is common for people to use GCP VM start-up scripts that will control the start process by following the commands in the script. But you can via the scripts also pass into the VM other kinds of metadata.</p>
<h3>Local SSDs</h3>
<p>However there is another type of disk storage that is very fast and should you have a requirement in your application for very high performance scratch space, you may want to attach a local SSD. However, a local SSD is part of the VM so be sure to store data of any permanent value somewhere else because local SSD's content doesn't survive when the VM terminates.</p>
<h3>Persistent Disks</h3>
<p>Anyway, most people will begin with using the standard persistent disks and that's the default.</p></pre>

        <pre>However there is another type of disk storage that is very fast and should you have a requirement in your application for very high performance scratch space, you may want to attach a local SSD. However, a local SSD is part of the VM so be sure to store data of any permanent value somewhere else because local SSD's content doesn't survive when the VM terminates. Because of this you cannot separate a VM and a local SSD disk as you can with a persistent disk. Anyway, most people will begin with using the standard persistent disks and that's the default.

Another convenient aspect of VM is taking backups. Once your VMs are running it is easy to take a durable snapshot of their disks. These are useful as backups but they also are required when you need to move a VM to another region.

Pre-emptive consideration is also important. You can save a lot of money if you choose to use pre-emptible VMs where they are appropriate. However, pre-emptible VMs are only suitable in certain use-cases as they behave differently from ordinary VMs. The difference is that with a pre-emptible VM you are effectively agreeing to allow the Compute Engine to terminate the VM should its resources be needed elsewhere and you will only get around 30 seconds warning.

Furthermore, a pre-emptive VM is guaranteed to be terminated after 24 hours if it hasn't already been pre-empted. However, if deployed wisely you can save a lot of money - around 80% discount - using pre-emptible VMs in the right scenarios, but be sure to make sure that your workloads are able to be stopped and restarted gracefully.

The next step is that you choose a boot image. As we have discussed already GCP offers a wide selection of Linux and Windows versions that are pre-configured but if you want you can import your own images. Indeed, a common request made by GCP customers is that they want their VMs to always boot with a specific configuration, such as installing specific updates or packages at boot time.

        <pre><h3>Understanding Compute Engine VMs in GCP</h3>
<p>When setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), several key factors come into play to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. Here are the main considerations:</p>
<h4>Disk Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local SSD</strong>: For high-performance scratch space, consider attaching a local SSD. However, data on local SSDs is lost when the VM terminates.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Disks</strong>: Most people start with standard persistent disks as the default. Persistent disks allow for permanent storage and can be separated from the VM.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backups</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taking durable snapshots of disk images is easy once your VMs are running. These snapshots serve as backups but also enable region migrations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pre-emptive VMs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Using pre-emptible VMs can save up to 80% compared to standard VMs, provided workloads can be stopped and restarted gracefully.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-emption Warning</strong>: You'll receive a 30-second warning before the VM is terminated due to resource needs elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Termination Guarantee</strong>: Pre-emptive VMs are guaranteed to be terminated after 24 hours if not pre-empted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Boot Image</h4>
<ul>
<li>GCP offers pre-configured Linux and Windows versions. Users can also import their own images for customized configurations.</li>
<li>Start-up scripts control the boot process, allowing users to pass metadata into the VM.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Auto-scaling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaling Out vs. Scaling Up</strong>: Most customers start by scaling out (adding more standard-sized VMs) rather than scaling up (increasing existing VM sizes).</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal and Vertical Scaling</strong>: Horizontal scaling involves adding more VMs for load balancing, while vertical scaling increases the size of existing VMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering these factors, users can optimize their Compute Engine VMs in GCP for performance, cost-effectiveness, and reliability.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Disk Storage Options</h3>
<p>The text discusses different types of disk storage options for Virtual Machines (VMs) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), including standard persistent disks and local SSDs. It highlights the importance of storing data of permanent value elsewhere due to the ephemeral nature of local SSDs.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Pre-emptible VMs</h3>
<p>Pre-emptible VMs are a cost-effective option, but they come with trade-offs in terms of resource availability and termination policies. Users must consider whether their workloads can be stopped and restarted gracefully before deploying pre-emptible VMs.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Boot Images</h3>
<p>The text emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate boot image for VMs, considering factors such as Linux or Windows versions, updates, and packages to install at boot time. GCP offers a wide selection of pre-configured images, and users can also import their own custom images.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Auto-scaling</h3>
<p>Auto-scaling is crucial in managing VM resources, particularly for workloads that require high performance and scalability. Users must decide between horizontal scaling (adding more standard-sized VMs) and vertical scaling (increasing the size of existing VMs), considering factors such as workload requirements and resource availability.</p></pre>
