        <pre>So, for example in our video transcription application we're running a home grown ETL processing script that we made, for the sake of expediency as we didn't want to change languages. However, throughout the evolution of the video transcription service there was a better ETL service available to us, Dataflow. It's a fully managed service, it scales better, and the algorithms are tuned, so perhaps we should stop procrastinating and switch over to Dataflow.

Resource Deployment

After the forecast and allocate stages comes deploy, and if you've been using your service level objectives and indicators, you will now have data to drive these numbers to support your forecasts. So it should be a lot easier to get approval, you have the data, you have forecasting, and you can calculate and justify what the subsequent costs will be to meet the design.

So now, you're going to go to the deploy phase and then start your testing. We want to make the testing realistic but easy to run, should also be customizable. After all we want to be able to catch obvious errors and handle simple use cases. But we also need to surface some of those stubborn intermittent issues that are more difficult to find. Therefore, we want to try to build in some kind of unit testing for reproducible or hard issues.

You should always first surface and then work through any issues before serving it up to your users. By striving to maintain the integrity of our application to the users we want to identify any bottlenecks or other user pain points and make the user experience as good as possible.

If you can do dark launches then do so, as this way you are going to be doing testing in an isolated launch. Then of course, you can start a slow stage and iterative process with canary deployments slowly rolling out. So if we do adversely affect our customer base it will be a very small percentage.

Pricing & Billing

A significant factor when designing for cloud deployments is that the method, techniques, and perspective of pricing vary tremendously between on-premises and cloud initiatives. Pricing is commonly used in on-premises for vendor evaluation and budget approval as it is typically very capital expense orientated i.e. you are pricing physical hardware for purchase or lease.

What is more, most of the projects' pricing will be on capital expenditure with operational expenses such as power and communications shared across the data centre. Pricing however in the cloud is much different because here you are pricing for the operational usage of resources with no capital outlay so it is more nuanced. But do not mistake this as being an opportunity to dispense with diligent pricing as it is still crucial to cost optimization, reducing cost, and for project budgeting.

When we said that pricing could be nuanced one example is that in Google Cloud Platform there is bulk-use discounting, which is built-in and automatic for many services. Conversely, there are discounts for resources that are rarely used such as with cold storage or pre-emptive VMs.

In this chapter, you will find out some of the ways and design choices, which can influence price.

        <pre><h1><strong>Migrating to a Better ETL Service: A Cloud Deployment Perspective</strong></h1>
<p>We're currently running a homegrown ETL processing script for our video transcription service, but we've been presented with an opportunity to switch to Dataflow, a fully managed service that scales better and has algorithms tuned for optimal performance. It's time to stop procrastinating and make the switch.</p>
<h2><strong>Resource Deployment</strong></h2>
<p>After forecasting and allocating resources, we'll enter the deploy phase. With data-driven service level objectives and indicators in hand, we'll have an easier time getting approval for our deployment. We'll also be able to calculate and justify subsequent costs more effectively.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth deployment, we'll focus on realistic yet easy-to-run testing that's customizable. This will allow us to catch obvious errors, handle simple use cases, and surface stubborn intermittent issues that are harder to find. We'll prioritize unit testing for reproducible or hard issues and strive to maintain the integrity of our application.</p>
<h2><strong>Dark Launches and Canary Deployments</strong></h2>
<p>If possible, we'll opt for dark launches to test in an isolated environment before rolling out to our users. This will minimize the impact on our customer base if any issues arise during deployment. We can then start with slow, iterative processes using canary deployments to gradually roll out changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Pricing and Billing</strong></h2>
<p>Cloud pricing is vastly different from on-premises pricing. In the cloud, we're paying for operational usage of resources without capital outlay, making it more nuanced. However, diligent pricing is still crucial for cost optimization, reducing costs, and project budgeting.</p>
<p>We'll explore design choices that can influence price, such as bulk-use discounting in Google Cloud Platform. We'll also examine discounts for rarely used resources like cold storage or preemptive VMs.</p>
<p>By understanding these factors, we can make informed decisions about our cloud deployment and ensure a successful transition to Dataflow.</p></pre>
