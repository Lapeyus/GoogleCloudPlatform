        <pre><h1>Designing the Network Architecture</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We learned so far about projects, networks, subnetworks, regions, and zones now let's see how they are specifically used in common network designs.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>A key design criterion for any network design is availability. Google Cloud Platform excels in the areas of reliability and availability because of its own highly reliable and robust SDN infrastructure that underpins all of Google's own applications and business activities but also due to its hierarchal design of regions and zones.</p>
<h3>Creating High Availability</h3>
<p>The fact that the SDN infrastructure allows subnetworks to communicate across zones makes creating a highly available application easy. Hence, should your application need increased availability for high business continuity, you could simply place two virtual machines into different zones within the same region and using the same subnetwork.</p>
<h4>Benefits of High Availability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very simple to deploy</li>
<li>Very effective way to instantly create high availability and automated fail-over</li>
<li>Convenient to secure as using a single subnetwork allows you to create a single firewall rule that is assigned across both zones</li>
</ul>
<h3>Globalization</h3>
<p>However, if we want to present our application to users around the world then we need to look to solutions that have global scale. In the high availability solution we proposed earlier, we placed resources in different zones within a single region, which provided the required improvements in reliability and availability for business continuity.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Globalization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provides global redundancy and high availability worldwide</li>
<li>Allows different geographical diverse failure domains</li>
<li>Can make use of global or regional load balancer to route traffic to the region that is closest to the user</li>
</ul>
<h3>Further Segregation</h3>
<p>If we now take this decomposition of our design and resources one step further by placing our application and resources in different regions within different networks and different projects, we will benefit from further segregation.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Further Segregation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provides additional security benefits</li>
<li>Allows for more granular control over access to resources</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Designing a robust network architecture requires careful consideration of availability, scalability, and security. By using Google Cloud Platform's SDN infrastructure and its hierarchal design of regions and zones, we can create highly available applications that meet the needs of users around the world.</p>

        <pre>Designing the Network Architecture

We learned so far about projects, networks, subnetworks, regions, and zones. Now let's see how they are specifically used in common network designs. The goal here is to get an appreciation of how they all can work together to deliver a robust network design architecture.

A key design criterion for any network design is availability. A network is of no use to us if we cannot access it. Let's take a look at the options at our disposal for delivering availability.

Google Cloud Platform excels in the areas of reliability and availability because of its own highly reliable and robust SDN infrastructure that underpins all of Google's own applications and business activities, as well as its hierarchical design of regions and zones. The fact that the SDN infrastructure allows subnetworks to communicate across zones makes creating a highly available application easy.

Should your application need increased availability for high business continuity, you could simply place two virtual machines into different zones within the same region and using the same subnetwork. This is very simple to deploy and very effective way to instantly create high availability and automated fail-over. However, it is not just simple to deploy; it is also convenient to secure as using a single subnetwork allows you to create a single firewall rule that is assigned across both zones.

However, if we want to present our application to users around the world, then we need to look for solutions with global scale. In the high availability solution we proposed earlier, we placed resources in different zones within a single region, which provided the required improvements in reliability and availability for business continuity. The solution also provided you with the required isolation from many types of infrastructure, hardware, and software failures.

Nonetheless, when we consider globalization, then putting our resources in different regions provides an even higher degree of redundancy and failure mitigation. Indeed, if we replicate our applications and resources across different regions, this will allow for different geographical diverse failure domains. Also, by replicating our design to create highly robust systems with resources spread across geographical regions, we can make use of global or regional load balancers, which we can use to route traffic to the region that is closest to the user.

Globalization does give us global redundancy and high availability worldwide but unfortunately, we no longer benefit from the simplified security that we got with the multi-zone, single subnetwork model. However, if the VMs are in a single network, then they can still communicate through GCP's internal global network.

If we now take this decomposition of our design and resources one step further by placing our application and resources in different regions within different networks and different projects, we will benefit from further segregation.

        <pre><h3>Network Architecture Design: A Robust Approach to Availability and Globalization</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Network designs rely on various components such as projects, networks, subnetworks, regions, and zones to deliver robust architectures. Understanding how these components work together is crucial for managing groups of resources with varying availability and access control requirements.</p>
<h4>Key Considerations for Network Design</h4>
<p>Availability is a critical design criterion for any network design. If the network is not available, it serves no purpose. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) excels in reliability and availability due to its highly reliable and robust SDN infrastructure, which underpins all of GCP's applications and business activities.</p>
<h4>High Availability Solutions</h4>
<p>To create high-availability applications, resources can be placed in different zones within a single region, providing improved reliability and availability for business continuity. This solution also provides isolation from various types of infrastructure, hardware, and software failures.</p>
<p>However, when considering globalization, placing resources in different regions provides an even higher degree of redundancy and failure mitigation. Replicating applications and resources across different regions allows for diverse geographical failure domains and enables the use of global or regional load balancers to route traffic to the closest region.</p>
<h4>Globalization and Segregation</h4>
<p>Globalization offers global redundancy and high availability worldwide but sacrifices simplified security. However, if virtual machines (VMs) are in a single network, they can still communicate through GCP's internal global network.</p>
<p>Taking this decomposition further by placing applications and resources in different regions within different networks and projects provides further segregation. This approach allows for even more robust network designs that cater to diverse requirements.</p>
<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

<li>Network designs rely on various components such as projects, networks, subnetworks, regions, and zones.</li>
<li>Availability is a critical design criterion for any network design.</li>
<li>GCP excels in reliability and availability due to its highly reliable and robust SDN infrastructure.</li>
<li>High-availability solutions can be achieved by placing resources in different zones within a single region or across multiple regions.</li>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: High Availability and Robustness</h3>
<p>High availability is a key design criterion for any network design. Google Cloud Platform excels in this area due to its highly reliable and robust SDN infrastructure that underpins all of Google's own applications and business activities.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Globalization and Redundancy</h3>
<p>Globalization provides an even higher degree of redundancy and failure mitigation by replicating resources across different regions, allowing for different geographical diverse failure domains. This enables the use of global or regional load balancers to route traffic to the region closest to the user.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Security Complexity</h3>
<p>Using a single subnetwork allows for easy security with a single firewall rule assigned across both zones, providing high availability without additional security complexity. However, when resources are placed in different regions, the simplified security of the multi-zone, single subnetwork model is lost.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Resource Segregation and Decomposition</h3>
<p>Further segregation can be achieved by placing application and resources in different regions within different networks and projects, allowing for even more granular control over resource management and access control requirements.</p></pre>
