        <pre><h1>IAM Concepts</h1>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>The permissions themselves are classes and methods in the APIs. For example, compute instances start, can be broken down into service, resource, and verb, meaning that this permission is used to start a stopped Compute Engine instance.</p>
<h2>Bundling Permissions</h2>
<p>Bundling all the permissions together to perform this task and then present it as a pre-configured role makes life a lot easier for the admin and greatly reduces errors.</p>
<h2>Custom Roles</h2>
<p>IAM custom roles allow you to make your own roles if there is not a suitable preconfigured role. You can create a custom role and then bundle all the prerequisite permissions to fulfil that particular role. However, this is no easy task so you are advised to look for the closest preconfigured role and then edit it by adding or removing specific permissions in order to meet your requirements.</p>
<h3>Custom Role Principles</h3>
<p>Custom roles require a lot of testing and can be considered to be risky but sometimes there is no alternative. When making up your custom roles, you should keep in mind the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members define who can do what on which resource. There are different types of members. Basically there are users, and there are service accounts. We will look at both in turn.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>Users can be members but they must have an identity that can be securely authenticated so GCP provides several ways - Google accounts, G Suite domains, Google Groups, or Cloud Identity domains;</p>
<h4>Google Accounts</h4>
<p>A Google account would be used by a user such as a developer, administrator, or any person who interacts with GCP. An email address that is associated with a Google account such as a gmail.com address can serve as an identity.</p>
<h4>G Suite Domains</h4>
<p>A G Suite domain represents a virtual group of all the members in an organization. G Suite customers can associate their email accounts with an Internet domain name. When you do this, each email account takes the form of username @mydomain.com. You can specify an identity by using an Internet domain name that is associated with a G suite account.</p>
<h4>Google Groups</h4>
<p>A Google Group is a named collection of Google account and service accounts. Every group has a unique email address that is associated with the group. Like groupname@mydomain.com. Google Groups are a convenient way to apply and access policy to a collection of users.</p>
<p>You can grant and change access controls for a whole group at once, instead of granting or changing access controls one at a time for individual users or service accounts.</p></pre>

You can create a custom role and then bundle all the prerequisite permissions to fulfil that particular role. However, this is no easy task so you are advised to look for the closest preconfigured role and then edit it by adding or removing specific permissions in order to meet your requirements.

Custom roles require a lot of testing and can be considered to be risky but sometimes there is no alternative. When making up your custom roles, you should keep in mind the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. After all, it would be very easy to give permissions to an employee or a group that enabled them to both raise invoices as well as to authorise payment on invoices.

Therefore, you really need to think hard when creating custom permissions as to why they are required and whether what they are attempting to achieve is compliant with company policy and regulatory standards.

Members
Members define who can do what on which resource. There are different types of members. Basically, there are users, and there are service accounts. We will look at both in turn.

Users can be members but they must have an identity that can be securely authenticated so GCP provides several ways - Google accounts, G Suite domains, Google Groups, or Cloud Identity domains.

A Google account would be used by a user such as a developer, administrator, or any person who interacts with GCP. An email address that is associated with a Google account such as a gmail.com address can serve as an identity.

A G Suite domain represents a virtual group of all the members in an organization. G Suite customers can associate their email accounts with an Internet domain name. When you do this, each email account takes the form of username @mydomain.com.

You can specify an identity by using an Internet domain name that is associated with a G suite account. A Google Group is a named collection of Google account and service accounts. Every group has a unique email address that is associated with the group.

Like groupname@mydomain.com. Google Groups are a convenient way to apply and access policy to a collection of users. You can grant and change access controls for a whole group at once, instead of granting or changing access controls one at a time for individual users or service accounts.

        <pre><h3>Permissions, Custom Roles, and Members in IAM</h3>
<p>Permissions are classes and methods in the APIs that define what actions can be performed on resources. For example, <code>compute.instances.start</code> is used to start a stopped Compute Engine instance.</p>
<p>Bundling all permissions together to perform a task makes life easier for admins and reduces errors. This approach also allows for pre-configured roles to be created, which are suitable alternatives when no custom role is required.</p>
<p>However, creating custom roles can be challenging and requires careful consideration of the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. Custom roles must be thoroughly tested and designed with caution to avoid granting excessive permissions that could compromise security.</p>
<h3>Members in IAM</h3>
<p>Members define who can perform actions on specific resources. There are two main types of members: users and service accounts.</p>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Users require a secure identity, which can be authenticated through various methods provided by GCP, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google accounts (e.g., Gmail addresses)</li>
<li>G Suite domains (virtual groups of organization members with email addresses in the form <code>username@mydomain.com</code>)</li>
<li>Google Groups (named collections of users and service accounts with unique email addresses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Granting access controls for a group can be more efficient than individual users or service accounts.</p>
<h4>Service Accounts</h4>
<p>Service accounts are used by applications, scripts, or other services to authenticate and perform actions on behalf of the organization. They require a secure identity as well, which can be authenticated through GCP's methods.</p>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>When creating custom roles, it is essential to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Least Privilege</strong>: Grant only necessary permissions to minimize risks.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Duties</strong>: Divide responsibilities among team members to prevent single points of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Company Policy and Regulatory Standards</strong>: Ensure that custom roles comply with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding how permissions, custom roles, and members work in IAM, organizations can implement robust security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Permissions and Roles in IAM</h3>
<p>Permissions are classes and methods in the APIs, allowing admins to perform specific tasks. Pre-configured roles simplify this process by bundling permissions together.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Custom Roles in IAM</h3>
<p>Custom roles enable admins to create their own roles if no pre-configured role is available. However, creating custom roles requires careful consideration of principles like least privilege and separation of duties to avoid potential risks.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Members in IAM</h3>
<p>Members define who can perform actions on specific resources. There are two main types of members: users and service accounts. Users must have a secure identity, such as a Google account or G Suite domain, while service accounts can be part of a group with a unique email address.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Identity and Authentication in IAM</h3>
<p>Identity refers to the authentication method used by users, which can include Google accounts, G Suite domains, Google Groups, or Cloud Identity domains. Each identity type has its own set of characteristics and benefits for applying access controls.</p></pre>
