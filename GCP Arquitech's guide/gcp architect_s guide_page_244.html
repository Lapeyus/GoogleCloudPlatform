        <pre><h1>Denial of Service Protection</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Google provides various denial-of-service (DoS) protection measures to safeguard its network. These measures are not publicly disclosed due to the need for transparency, but they can be utilized by users behind a global load balancer.</p>
<h2>Built-in Network Protection</h2>
<p>The Google network already offers robust protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>SDN (Software-Defined Networking)</li>
<li>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</li>
<li>Global Load Balancers</li>
</ul>
<p>These components work together to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.</p>
<h2>Additional Measures for VPCs Behind Load Balancers</h2>
<p>To further enhance protection, users can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter known bad traffic or specific countries using firewall rules</li>
<li>Block traffic on different ports and protocols</li>
<li>Utilize VM traffic throttling, which limits throughput per VM to approximately 10 Gbps for Ingress</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defending Against Infrastructure Attacks</h2>
<p>In the event of a DoS attack that is not detected by network security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure remains protected by cloud load balancers and auto scaling.</li>
<li>To absorb the attack, users can scale up by adding more resources or split traffic between different regions using a global load balancer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example: Absorbing Traffic from Different Regions</h2>
<p>If a user is subjected to a DoS attack originating from Asia but is based in the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can spin up a region in Asia to absorb the traffic and potentially thwart the attack.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>As we have already seen, there are a lot of denial-of-service protection actually built in to the Google network. However, there are others that Google has available to you if you are behind a global load balancer. These denial of service controls are not published and are against the ethos of transparency but that is deemed to be necessary in blocking these types of denial-of-services attacks.

Often denial of service attacks may sometimes be indistinguishable from actual production traffic, so it requires careful monitoring. This is why Google takes responsibility for this type of attack using round-the-clock monitoring, quotas, and limits. Another interesting way that Google protects against DDoS at the edge is to provide Cloud CDN as it protects and maximizes available bandwidth.

This is done through caching content at many points-of-present locations at the edge using Google Cloud CDN. However, once more you have to have a global load balancer to gain the benefit. This is because it's the load balancer that's automatically detects and terminates inbound connections. Typically, the load balancers will drop all UDP floods and also SYN floods which can exhaust the TCP connections pool.

So, as we have seen, the network already protects against distributed denial-of-service attacks through its scale, SDN, CDN, and global load balancers. So put your VPC behind a load balancer protected by firewall rules so that you can filter any known bad traffic or certain countries you know won't be using your service. You can also block on different ports and protocols.

In addition, there is a technique available called VM traffic throttling. This only allows about 10 gigs of throughput per VM for Ingress. The Google network protects VMs against large-scale and sustained VM attacks, but there's also built-in protections using quota and limits. So, that is something of a benefit, but as we said earlier, sometimes it's hard to determine natural production traffic from a denial-of-service attack especially if the increase in connections, CPU or memory usage and bandwidth consumption is gradual.

Defending the Infrastructure
Should a denial of service attack not be detected by the network security controls, the infrastructure is still protected by cloud load balancers and auto scaling. At some point, you may need to absorb the attack and it may be for a brief period of time. However, in this case, you can scale up by adding more resources, but that might be expensive.

An alternative technique is to split traffic between different regions and you can do this if you're using a global load balancer. For example, if you are subjected to a denial-of-service attack which is originating from Asia and you're based in the US, you could literally spin up a region in Asia, this way you could absorb that traffic and that might help in thwarting that particular attack.

Another technique available is VM traffic throttling, which only allows about 10 gigs of throughput per VM for Ingress. The Google network protects VMs against large-scale and sustained VM attacks, but there's also built-in protections using quota and limits. So, that is something of a benefit, but as we said earlier, sometimes it's hard to determine natural production traffic from a denial-of-service attack especially if the increase in connections, CPU or memory usage and bandwidth consumption is gradual.

In conclusion, Google provides various techniques for protecting against denial-of-service attacks. These include using Cloud CDN, VM traffic throttling, and splitting traffic between different regions. Each of these techniques has its own benefits and limitations, and it's essential to choose the right approach based on your specific needs and infrastructure.

        <pre><h3>Google's Denial of Service Protection Measures</h3>
<p>Google has implemented various denial-of-service (DoS) protection measures to safeguard its network. While some of these measures are not publicly disclosed due to the need for transparency, others are available to users behind a global load balancer.</p>
<h4>Network Protection</h4>
<p>The Google network itself provides scale, SDN, CDN, and global load balancers as part of its defense against distributed denial-of-service attacks. These components work together to detect and mitigate traffic patterns that may indicate a DoS attack.</p>
<h3>Additional Measures for Users Behind Global Load Balancers</h3>
<p>For users behind a global load balancer, Google offers additional protection measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud CDN</strong>: This service protects bandwidth by caching content at multiple edge locations. However, it requires a global load balancer to function effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall Rules</strong>: Users can filter known bad traffic or block access from specific countries using firewall rules.</li>
<li><strong>VM Traffic Throttling</strong>: This technique limits the throughput of individual VMs for Ingress to approximately 10 Gbps. While this provides some protection, it may not always distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defending Against Denial-of-Service Attacks</h3>
<p>In the event of a DoS attack that is not detected by network security controls, the infrastructure remains protected by cloud load balancers and auto scaling. However, in cases where sustained attacks are involved, absorbing the traffic for an extended period may be expensive.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to split traffic between different regions using a global load balancer. For example, if an attack originates from Asia and the user is based in the US, spinning up a region in Asia can help absorb the traffic and potentially thwart the attack.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google's network provides scale, SDN, CDN, and global load balancers to defend against distributed denial-of-service attacks.</li>
<li>Additional protection measures are available for users behind global load balancers, including Cloud CDN, firewall rules, and VM traffic throttling.</li>
<li>Defending against DoS attacks requires careful monitoring and may involve absorbing traffic for an extended period or splitting traffic between regions.</li>
