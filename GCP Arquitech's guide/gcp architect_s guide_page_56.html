        <pre>Here's the reformatted text:

Cloud SQL provides several benefits for managing relational databases in Google Cloud Platform. Firstly, CloudSQL helps you backup your data with either On-Demand or scheduled backups. Secondly, CloudSQL can scale both vertically by changing the machine type and horizontally via read replicas. Moreover, if we consider Cloud SQL from a security perspective, you will get as part of the managed service, network firewalls, encrypted data on Google's internal networks, and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups.

Another benefit of CloudSQL instances is they are readily accessible by other GCP services and even external services. This means you can easily authorize Compute Engine instances to access CloudSQL instances and configure the CloudSQL instance to be in the same zone as your virtual machine for low latency and high performance. Finally when it comes to administration, you can manage CloudSQL just like on-premises database as it supports other applications and tools like SQL Workbench, Toad, and other external applications that use standard MySQL drivers.

However, if you have outgrown your present relational database or require sharding your databases in order to scale horizontally, have a demand for higher throughput and higher performance, or need transactional consistency at a global scale and strong consistency, or just want to consolidate your databases, you might want to consider using Cloud Spanner. Natural use cases for Cloud Spanner include financial applications, and inventory applications.

You would be well advised to consider using Cloud SQL for relational database support especially if you use MySQL or PostgreSQL or if you require vast scale then try Cloud Spanner. If you need full SQL support for an online transaction processing system then Cloud SQL provides terabytes of capacity, while Cloud Spanner provides petabytes of capacity. If Cloud SQL does not fit your requirements because you need horizontal scalability not just through the replicas, consider using Cloud Spanner.

Cloud Spanner is a highly scalable NoSQL database that can provide petabytes of capacity and offer transactional consistency at a global scale. It also supports relational schemas, SQL, and even synchronous replication for high availability.

Cloud Datastore is another data storage service provided by Google Cloud Platform, which is a highly scalable NoSQL database designed to store structured data from App Engine apps. You can utilize Cloud Datastore as the integration point when you build solutions that span App Engine and Compute Engine VMs.

As you would expect from a fully managed service, Google handles all Cloud Datastore administration as it is designed to shard and replicate, providing you with a highly available and durable database that scales automatically to handle your workload. Unlike Cloud Bigtable, it also offers transactions that can affect multiple database rows, and it lets you do SQL-like queries.

In summary, the choice between Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and Cloud Datastore depends on your specific requirements and use cases.
