        <pre>Serverless, with Service Mesh

Today, serverless computing transforms your source code into workloads that are executed only when called or triggered by an event. Organizations are adopting the serverless approach as it decouples code from infrastructure, which in turn reduces infrastructure costs, increases efficiency while simultaneously allowing developers to focus on writing code that delivers more business value.

However, today most organizations are typically running heterogeneous development environments so are not solely running serverless workloads. Indeed they are also likely to have stateful applications, including microservices apps within containers on Kubernetes infrastructure. Therefore, the GCSM allows Kubernetes users to deploy container applications and serverless functions onto the same cluster.

Further, the ability to work with serverless functions in the same way that you work with your traditional containers helps you to provide a uniformed standard methodology between your serverless and Kubernetes environments. This means that you can use the same Istio traffic rules, certificate issuance, authorization policies, and metrics uniformly across all your workload pipelines.

Portability

Organizations are increasingly adopting more complex cluster configurations as they reap the benefits of code portability. But this requires lower latency, security, and the need for tools that span both cloud and on-premise. Hence, Google's Cloud Services Platform is there to provide the interoperable environment, which can combine complementary solutions that include Google Kubernetes Engine, GKE On-Premise, and Istio. The goal is to move towards creating a seamless Kubernetes experience across hybrid development environments.

Use Case - 8

The client ABC is looking over your proposal with interest but they are becoming confused when they do their own research into GCP as they cannot differentiate between the services and how they are used. They request that you provide a high-level summary of each with perhaps some use-cases?

Solution
In order to meet the clients' request, you can summarize the difference between the services in a brief summary.

PROS

App Engine Standard
This is a cost-effective way to host development apps or production platforms for APIs or low throughput apps.
Serverless, with Service Mesh
This approach transforms your source code into workloads that are executed only when called or triggered by an event, decoupling code from infrastructure and reducing costs while increasing efficiency.

<p>Serverless computing transforms source code into workloads that are executed only when called or triggered by an event, decoupling code from infrastructure and reducing costs while increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>However, most organizations run heterogeneous development environments, including stateful applications and microservices apps within containers on Kubernetes infrastructure. The Google Cloud Service Mesh (GCSM) allows Kubernetes users to deploy container applications and serverless functions onto the same cluster, providing a uniform standard methodology between serverless and Kubernetes environments.</p>
<p>This enables the use of the same Istio traffic rules, certificate issuance, authorization policies, and metrics across all workload pipelines. Additionally, GCSM provides portability, allowing organizations to adopt more complex cluster configurations while maintaining lower latency, security, and tools that span both cloud and on-premise.</p>
