        <pre>Securing Your Data

Your objects will be stored as encrypted data when it is at rest or in-flight, but there will usually be others that need to access the data. Therefore, GCP provides several ways to control access to your objects and buckets. The preferred way to control access and assign user permissions is to use Cloud IAM. When you deploy IAM to authenticate and authorize users, the most efficient way is for you to assign roles and the permission attached to each of the roles is inherited from project to bucket to object.

In some cases, you may feel that you need finer control, in which case you can create access control lists (ACLS) that offer greater granularity for specific users. Typically, you will use ACLs to define who has access to your buckets and objects and then what they are authorized to do. Each ACL you configure consists of a scope that defines who can perform the specified actions, which can be a specific user or group of users, and a permission that defines what actions can be performed. For example, read or write.

However, when data is stored in a bucket, that Cloud Storage object becomes immutable, so if you need to change the object, you have to create a new version. To help you keep track of the versions, you can turn on object versioning on your buckets. If you activate versioning, then Cloud Storage keeps a history of modifications. You can list the archived versions of an object, restore an object to an older state, or permanently delete a version as needed.

However, with versioning, there is the risk of junk accumulating, so Cloud Storage also offers life-cycle management policies. In this case, you could instruct Cloud Storage to keep only the three most recent versions of each object in a bucket that has versioning enabled. But the policies can be flexible, and you could also delete objects older than 365 days or create a policy that will delete objects created before a certain date.

Cloud Storage Classes

Another important consideration when using Cloud storage is that you must choose the type of storage class that best suits your needs. There are four different types of storage classes: regional, multi-regional, nearline, and coldline. All of the storage classes are accessed in comparable ways using the cloud storage API and they all offer millisecond access types. However, that's where the similarity ends.

Multi-regional and regional are high-performance object storage designed for frequent access, whereas nearline and coldline are designed for infrequent access for backup and archival storage, and as we will learn, they are priced accordingly. You must be clear on the storage classes or you could pay over the odds for the wrong service class.

Regional vs. Multi Regional

Regional storage allows you to create your bucket and store your data in a specific GCP region, such as US Central, Europe West, or Asia East. It's cheaper than multi-regional storage but offers less redundancy.

<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose you want to store sensitive data in a bucket that requires high security measures. Which GCP service would you recommend using, and why?
Answer: Cloud IAM with roles and permissions assigned from project to bucket to object, as it provides the most efficient way to control access and authenticate users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're planning to use nearline storage for infrequent data access, how can you optimize your data management strategy?
Answer: By implementing life-cycle management policies that automatically delete older versions of objects after a specified period or date, reducing storage costs and improving data efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you handle the situation where an employee leaves the company and no longer needs access to sensitive data stored in a bucket?
Answer: You would remove their access permissions using Cloud IAM or ACLs, and potentially update the bucket's permissions to ensure only authorized personnel have access to the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're planning to use multi-regional storage for frequent data access, how can you ensure that your data is redundant across multiple regions?
Answer: By configuring Cloud Storage to replicate data across multiple regions, using features such as replication groups and regional buckets with automatic replication enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose you want to implement a data retention policy in GCP that automatically deletes objects older than 365 days. What steps would you take?
Answer: You would create a life-cycle management policy that specifies the retention period (e.g., 365 days) and configure Cloud Storage to enforce this policy, ensuring that older versions of objects are deleted as needed.</p>
