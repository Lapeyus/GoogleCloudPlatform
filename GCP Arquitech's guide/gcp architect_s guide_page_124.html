        <pre><h1>Cloud Resource Management</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud resource management involves organizing resources into a hierarchical structure, with each level having its own set of roles and permissions.</p>
<h3># Roles and Permissions</h3>
<h4>## Folder Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin</strong>: Full administrative control over all folders.</li>
<li><strong>Creator</strong>: Browse folder hierarchy, create folders.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong>: View folders and projects, view sub-folders.</li>
</ul>
<h4>## Project Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Create new products, automatically owner.</li>
<li><strong>Project Leader</strong>: Deletion privileges for projects.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong>: View projects.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: Edit projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3># Product-Specific Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compute Engine's Instance Admin role: Create, modify, delete virtual machine instances and disks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>## Cloud IAM Policy</h4>
<p>Resource Manager policies secure projects and resources. However, strict control over policy changes and group memberships is necessary to prevent permissions creep.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Hierarchical Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy for teams and departments.</li>
<li>Delegation of administration rights at the folder level.</li>
<li>Restricted access to resources in particular folders.</li>
</ul>
<h3># Example Use Case</h3>
<p>A company has a hierarchical structure with organizational, folder, project, and resource levels. Each level has its own set of roles and permissions, ensuring that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks.</p>
<h4>## Table: Roles and Permissions</h4>
<p>| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | Full administrative control over all folders. |
| Creator | Browse folder hierarchy, create folders. |
| Viewer | View folders and projects, view sub-folders. |</p>
<p>| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Create new products, automatically owner. |
| Project Leader | Deletion privileges for projects. |
| Viewer | View projects. |
| Editor | Edit projects. |</p>
<h4>## Table: Product-Specific Roles</h4>
<p>| Product | Role Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compute Engine | Instance Admin role: Create, modify, delete virtual machine instances and disks. |</p>
<h3># Best Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apply the minimum access required to perform a role.</li>
<li>Strict control over policy changes and group memberships is necessary to prevent permissions creep.</li>
</ul>
<h4>## Table: Cloud IAM Policy</h4>
<p>| Policy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Resource Manager policies | Secure projects and resources. |
| Strict control over policy changes and group memberships | Prevent permissions creep. |</p>
<h3># Conclusion</h3>
<p>Cloud resource management involves organizing resources into a hierarchical structure, with each level having its own set of roles and permissions. A well-designed hierarchy ensures that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their tasks, while preventing permissions creep.</p></pre>

        <pre>Each team folder could contain several additional subfolders to represent different applications, development areas, test-beds, or staging areas. Folders also allow autonomy as they allow delegation of administration rights at the folder level. So, for example, each head of a department can be granted full viewer and auditing roles for all GCP resources that belong to their departments.

Similarly, access privileges can also be restricted to prevent access to resources in particular folders. Users in one department only gain access and create GCP resources within their own folder.

Resource Manager Roles can be applied while keeping in mind the best practice of applying the minimum access required to perform a role and that policies are inherited top to bottom. Indeed, we have seen this applied in the top-level organisational node. However, the folder node also has multiple roles that mimic the organisational roles, but are applied only to resources within a folder.

There is an admin role that provides full administrative control over all folders. There is also a creator role, which enables browsing of the folder hierarchy and creating new folders. Additionally, there is a viewer role, which allows members to view folders and their projects and subfolders.

Similarly, when we look at roles at the project level, we see that there is a creator role that allows a user to create new products, making that user automatically the owner. There's also a project leader role that grants deletion privileges for projects.

Project Roles Overall, we have seen that at each level of the hierarchy such as at the organization, folder, project, and resource - we have specific roles. Project roles mimic the primitive roles in that there is a viewer, editor, and owner role, and all these roles are concentric. A project owner can also invite others to become project owners.

Extending an invitation is done by sending an email from the GCP console and having the prospective project owner accept the invitation. This type of email invitation is only available for project owner roles and not for other roles.

With regards to the many product-specific roles, like the Compute Engine's Instance Admin role, which provides permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances and disks. These are resource and product specific so each product or service has several of these roles.

Cloud IAM Policy Resource Manager policies can secure your projects and their resources but you also want more granular control as to how users will gain access to resources through the application of IAM policies and group memberships. Without strict control over policy changes and group memberships, you tend towards permissions creep.

This is what tends to happen in all environments and organisations when the users, typical due to changes in role, eventually and inadvertently gain more permissions than they need, which violates the principle of least privilege.

        <pre><h3>Organizational Structure and Access Control in GCP</h3>
<p>Each team folder can contain multiple subfolders representing different applications, development areas, test-beds, or staging areas. This allows for autonomy at the folder level, enabling delegation of administration rights to department heads, who can be granted full viewer and auditing roles for all GCP resources within their departments.</p>
<h3>Resource Manager Roles</h3>
<p>Resource Manager Roles provide a hierarchical structure with multiple roles that mimic organizational roles but are applied only to resources within a folder. These roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin role: provides full administrative control over all folders</li>
<li>Creator role: enables browsing the folder hierarchy and creating new folders</li>
<li>Viewer role: allows members to view folders, projects, and subfolders</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Roles</h3>
<p>Project Roles follow a concentric structure with viewer, editor, and owner roles. A project owner can invite others to become project owners by sending an email invitation through the GCP console.</p>
<h3>Product-Specific Roles</h3>
<p>Product-specific roles, such as Compute Engine's Instance Admin role, provide permissions for specific resources and services. Each product or service has multiple roles that cater to different needs.</p>
<h3>Cloud IAM Policy</h3>
<p>Resource Manager policies can secure projects and resources but may not provide enough granular control over user access. Applying strict controls over policy changes and group memberships is crucial to prevent permissions creep, which violates the principle of least privilege.</p></pre>
