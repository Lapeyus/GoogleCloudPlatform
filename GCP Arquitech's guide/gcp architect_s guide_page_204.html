        <pre>The advantages of using Kubernetes Engine clusters are that they can scale automatically to meet demand, allowing you to only pay for the nodes that are being used. This can save a significant amount of waste and provide major cost savings.

Pre-emptive VMs (PVMs) are affordable, short-lived compute instances suitable for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads. They offer the same machine types and options as regular compute instances but have a limited lifespan of up to 24 hours. However, some workloads may not be suitable or benefit from PVMs.

To address this, it's common to build two pools of nodes into the cluster: one for standard VMs (pool-a) and another for PVMs (pool-b). This ensures that there will always be nodes available to meet the workload. The advantage is that PMVS with GPUs can become affordable due to large discounts (approximately 50%).

Autoscaler works well with PVMs, allowing them to spin up replacements if available or spin up a standard VM node as a fallback. By using PVMs, you can also choose CPU or Memory optimized machine types, which are now affordable and suitable for your workloads.

However, it's essential to be aware that PVMs only last 24 hours maximum. If provisioned in the same pool, they will terminate at the same time. To mitigate this, an open-source solution like Estafette GKE Pre-emptible Killer can spread out the termination of PVMs, ensuring they don't all get deleted simultaneously.

A basic architect for a Kubernetes Engine cluster with PVMs might look like this:

Kubernetes Engine Cluster
Master Node
Zone-A
Instance
Zone-B Instance
Group PVM-pool
Group PVM-pool
Instance Group Default-
Instance
Group Default-
pool
pool
Zone-A
Zone-B
Google Kubernetes Engine

When advising developers on which Cloud Platform to deploy their containerized application, consider the following:

* Kubernetes Engine: Suitable for applications that require control over VM resources and benefit from Docker image development.
* App Engine-Flex: A good choice when you want to decouple your application from the underlying infrastructure and focus on developing your application.

Ultimately, the decision depends on the specific needs of your application and the considerations mentioned above.

        <pre><h3>Kubernetes Engine Clusters: Advantages and Considerations</h3>
<p>Kubernetes Engine clusters offer several advantages, including automatic scaling to meet demand, which can save costs by only paying for used nodes. This approach reduces waste and allows for more efficient use of resources.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive VMs (PVMs) provide significant cost savings, especially when combined with GPUs. However, they have a limited lifespan of 24 hours and should be designed to run in parallel with standard VMs to ensure availability. To mitigate this limitation, an open-source solution called Estafette GKE Pre-emptible Killer can be used to spread out the termination of PVMs.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Cloud Platform for Containerized Applications</h3>
<p>When deciding which cloud platform to deploy containerized applications, several considerations and differentiators should be taken into account. The main options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kubernetes Engine</strong>: Offers automatic scaling, cost savings through pre-emptive VMs, and control over VM resources.</li>
<li><strong>App Engine-Flex</strong>: Provides a managed environment for running containers, but may not offer the same level of control as Kubernetes Engine.</li>
<li><strong>Compute Engine</strong>: Allows for absolute control over VM resources, making it suitable for applications that require customized environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the choice of platform depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application.</p></pre>
