        <pre><h1>Cloud Functions</h1>
<h2>Why Cloud Functions?</h2>
<h3>Benefits of Cloud Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relieve yourself from the chore of managing infrastructure, capacity planning and to build or extend your application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Cloud Functions Work</h3>
<p>When you deploy applications through Cloud Functions, you only need to supply chunks of code for business logic, you set the event triggers and attach the code and it will get spun up on demand in response to specific events to create functions.</p>
<h2>Microservices and Service Mesh</h2>
<h3>Challenges with Microservices Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased complexity as the process of decoupling a single-tier monolithic application into many smaller service modules introduces many design hurdles.</li>
<li>Difficulty in monitoring, updating or securing microservices when you don't have visibility into what services are running.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solution: Service Mesh</h3>
<p>A service mesh is a software solution that helps you discover and make sense of all those thousands of interconnections between services. It also helps with orchestration, security, and collecting telemetry data across distributed microservices and containers.</p>
<h2>Comparison to Other Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compute Engine: ideal for full control over deployment and management in virtual machines.</li>
<li>Kubernetes Engine: defines a measure of control through clusters.</li>
<li>App Engine: ideal for focusing on code and leaving infrastructure provisioning and management to Google.</li>
<li>App Engine Flexible Environment: allows retaining some control of custom runtime environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table: Comparison of Options</h3>
<p>| Option | Control | Infrastructure Provisioning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compute Engine | Full | Yes |
| Kubernetes Engine | Measure of control | No |
| App Engine | Minimal | Yes |
| App Engine Flexible Environment | Customizable | Yes |</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cloud Functions provides a way to deploy applications with minimal infrastructure management, while still allowing for some control over custom runtime environments. A service mesh can help address the challenges of microservices architecture by providing visibility, orchestration, security, and telemetry data collection.</p></pre>

        <pre>Why Cloud Functions?

If we cast our memory back to the first chapter, we mentioned a design issue where there's managed infrastructure at one end of the scale and extreme dynamic infrastructure at the other. However, you'll often come to the conclusion that you can choose where you want to be along that line. For example, you may choose to be further towards the Compute Engine if you want full control to deploy and manage your application in virtual machines that run on Google's infrastructure. Similarly, if you need control but want to use containers, then you can use the Kubernetes Engine as these clusters define a measure of control.

On the other hand, you may well choose to relinquish much of the control and management burden and select to use the App Engine service as it is ideal if you just want to focus on your code and leave infrastructure provisioning and management to Google. Conversely, standard environment may be too restrictive as you may want to retain some control of your custom runtime environment, which is what the App Engine flexible environment lets you do.

Of course, to relieve yourself from the chore of managing infrastructure, capacity planning, and building or extending your application, then you can use Cloud Functions. When you deploy applications through Cloud Functions, you only need to supply chunks of code for business logic, set the event triggers, and attach the code. It will get spun up on demand in response to specific events to create functions.

Microservices and Service Mesh

Adopting microservices architecture to decompose large monolithic applications can bring many benefits, including increased flexibility, independence, and modularity. However, these benefits often come at the expense of added complexity as the process of decoupling a single-tier monolithic application into many smaller service modules introduces many design hurdles.

For example, when you decompose a monolith down to 1000s of autonomous microservices, how do you know what's running? Indeed, if you don't have visibility into what microservices are running, how do you monitor, update, or secure your microservices? To address these significant challenges, you can always deploy a service mesh.

A service mesh is a software solution that helps you discover and make sense of all those thousands of interconnections between services. It also helps with orchestration, security, and collecting telemetry data across distributed microservices and containers.

The way that a service mesh works is that it decouples your application's dependency from the network. Thus, it can monitor all traffic for your application, typically through a set of network proxies or sidecars that sit alongside each microservice. These sidecar proxies provide individual policy implementation and even language independence at the microservices level.

This in turn allows local and remote development teams to work independently and be language agnostic.

        <pre><h3>Why Cloud Functions?</h3>
<p>Cloud Functions offers a solution for developers who want to relinquish control over infrastructure provisioning and management but still need to focus on their code. By using Cloud Functions, you can deploy applications with only the necessary chunks of code for business logic, set event triggers, and have the function spun up on demand in response to specific events.</p>
<h3>Microservices and Service Mesh</h3>
<p>Adopting microservices architecture can bring benefits such as increased flexibility, independence, and modularity. However, this approach also introduces complexity, making it challenging to monitor, update, or secure individual microservices. To address these challenges, service meshes are deployed. A service mesh is a software solution that helps discover and make sense of interconnections between services, providing orchestration, security, and telemetry data collection.</p>
<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Functions allows developers to choose where they want to be along the infrastructure scale, from managed to dynamic.</li>
<li>Microservices architecture can bring benefits but also introduces complexity, making it challenging to manage individual microservices.</li>
<li>Service meshes are deployed to address these challenges, providing visibility, orchestration, security, and telemetry data collection across distributed services.</li>
