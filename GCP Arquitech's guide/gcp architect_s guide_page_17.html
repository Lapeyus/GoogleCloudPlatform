        <pre>Use Case: 1

A start-up business ABC Technology has sent an RFC (Request for Proposal) for a proposal to accommodate growth, business continuity, and disaster recovery for the business, their applications, and data. Their entire operation is presently dependent on on-premises hardware that supports a three-tier web application consisting of webserver, application server, and a database. They have three set-ups: one for production, another for development and testing, and another for data storage/archive. They are looking for a cost-effective and high-performance solution.

Solution

As a first stage, you could propose that the client mirrors their on-premises architecture to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using Virtual Machines (VMs) in Compute Engine. This is readily achievable and can be quickly prototyped for demonstration. All that would be required is to reproduce their current architecture to GCP using VMs and lift and shift the code and data.

By mirroring and then replicating the databases to the cloud, you will have solved their business continuity and disaster recovery requirements with an easy-to-implement solution. However, it's essential to address the cost-effectiveness of this solution. To do so, we would need to ascertain the desired level of continuity requirement, such as how much downtime and data loss can the business accept.

If the client is flexible regarding their recovery time objectives (RTO), it would be possible to build and test a warm DR cloud environment. In this case, you would build the cloud infrastructure replicate the databases and leave them active but tear down everything else after copying the configuration into a deployment manager template.

This would mean that you could rapidly recreate the environment on demand. However, if the RTO is zero, we would need to build and run the entire cloud architecture 24/7, which would have significant financial consequences. Nevertheless, addressing the issue of accommodating growth and scale is crucial.

To achieve this, you might suggest that after the first stage is complete and the client is happy with the cloud infrastructure, they switch over to using it exclusively for local storage and archiving of data. As GCP is elastic and highly scalable, this would provide automatic scalability of the hardware needed for forecasted growth.

You could also detail a third stage whereby they later retire the on-premises data centre altogether and replicate everything in the cloud and mirror the infrastructure and storage across two zones or regions. This solution would meet all their objectives for handling growth.

        <pre><p><strong>Proposal for Architectural Change to Accommodate Growth, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery</strong></p>
<p>ABC Technology has sent an RFC for a proposal to address their growing needs for business continuity, disaster recovery, and scalability. Their current on-premises infrastructure supports a three-tier web application with limited room for growth.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Proposal: Mirroring On-Premises Architecture to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong></p>
<p>As a first stage, propose mirroring their on-premises architecture to GCP using VMs in Compute Engine. This approach is readily achievable and can be quickly prototyped for demonstration. By lifting and shifting the code and data, you will have solved their business continuity and disaster recovery requirements with an easy-to-implement solution.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Effectiveness Considerations</strong></p>
<p>To address cost effectiveness, it's essential to determine the desired level of continuity requirement, including acceptable downtime and data loss. If the client is flexible regarding recovery time objectives (RTO), a warm DR cloud environment can be built, replicating databases while leaving other components active. This approach allows for rapid recreation of the environment on demand.</p>
<p>However, if RTO is zero, building and running the entire cloud architecture 24/7 would have significant financial consequences. To address growth and scalability, suggest switching to using GCP as the primary infrastructure after completing the first stage, with on-premises serving as a backup site for local storage and archiving of data.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Solution</strong></p>
<p>Propose a third stage where the on-premises data center is retired, and everything is replicated in the cloud. Mirroring the infrastructure and storage across two zones or regions would ensure business continuity and disaster recovery while providing automatic scalability to accommodate forecasted growth.</p>
<p>This solution meets all of ABC Technology's objectives for handling growth, ensuring a cost-effective and high-performance solution that addresses their evolving needs.</p></pre>
