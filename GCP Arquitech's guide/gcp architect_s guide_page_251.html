        <pre><h1>Security Vulnerability Audit</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When trying to identify any security vulnerabilities, you start by auditing your existing architecture. To do this, you could use the Cloud Security Scanner to surface known vulnerabilities and then work through those identified to remediate any issues.</p>
<h2>Architecture Review</h2>
<p>Now we never addressed security as part of the initial design because there are several important GCP vulnerability controls in place. For example, GCP built-in security within the network, with HTTP Global Load Balancing, in Cloud Load Balancing, and default VPC configurations.</p>
<h3>Security Controls</h3>
<p>Nonetheless, we really haven't specified any internal IP addresses, private networks, firewall rules, or any other security controls.</p>
<h2>Front-end Security</h2>
<p>The first pass of the security audit surfaces an issue with the front-end security so we need to lock-down the external facing webservers.</p>
<h3>Security Techniques</h3>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some security techniques already deployed for us such as the default firewall and its rules when we created our webserver VMs. We also have built-in network protections because of those Global Load Balancers as they protect against major denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<h2>Denial of Service (DoS) Security</h2>
<p>We could bolster DoS security further by adding Cloud CDN and Cloud DNS to the design but what we do need to consider is implementing auto-scaling for the front-end cluster to absorb the attack by adding additional servers.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>gaining unauthorised access to sensitive user information. However, our other major risk is hackers gaining access and potentially we already have a Virtual Private Cloud, and so we are using private Psubnet range, this prevents a hacker getting directly inside from the internet.</p>
<h2>Isolation and Access Control</h2>
<p>Therefore, the first layer of defence must be to prevent hackers gaining a foothold on the public facing webservers. After all, we don't want them using the webservers as a launching pad for attacks on the internal application servers.</p>
<h3>Private IP Addressing</h3>
<p>To isolate the upload web servers by using private IP addressing g on their internal interfaces. By giving them private IPs means that if these web servers are going to talk to the back end, they are going to need a secondary NIC in the same private network as the back end servers.</p>
<h2>Firewall and Access Control</h2>
<p>We have added firewalls and firewall rules to restrict access to only certain ports. We have also addressed the denial of service risk by making the design more scalable and reliable by adding auto-scaling to the front-end group.</p>
<h3>Private Addresses and Zones</h3>
<p>We have restricted access to the backend servers by giving them private addresses which are inaccessible from the internet. Hence, they can only be accessed via the frontend servers secondary interface that resides in the private address space. Also, as the design is now in separate zones, we can isolate against fault tolerances.</p>
<h2>IAM and Security Accounts</h2>
<p>However, there is also assumed implicit trust between all components on the network so we should consider utilizing security accounts via IAM.</p></pre>

Now we never addressed security as part of the initial design because there are several important GCP vulnerability controls in place. For example, GCP built-in security within the network, with HTTP Global Load Balancing, in Cloud Load Balancing, and default VPC configurations.

After all, we don't want them using the webservers as a launching pad for attacks on the internal application servers. The first step is to isolate the upload web servers by using private IP addressing on their internal interfaces.

By giving them private IPs, means that if these web servers are going to talk to the back end, they are going to need a secondary NIC in the same private network as the back end servers. We can use the same strategy of private addressing and the same subnet to lockdown the backend storage. So we will be accessing the GCS and the CBT over the private network as well.

Working through our security checklist based upon the original design, we have added firewalls and firewall rules to restrict access to only certain ports. We have also addressed the denial of service risk by making the design more scalable and reliable by adding auto-scaling to the front-end group. We have also restricted access to the backend servers by giving them private addresses which are inaccessible from the internet.

Hence, they can only be accessed via the frontend servers secondary interface that resides in the private address space. Also, as the design is now in separate zones, we can isolate against fault tolerances. However, there is also assumed implicit trust between all components on the network, so we should consider utilizing security accounts via IAM.

        <pre><h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the first step in identifying security vulnerabilities when auditing an existing architecture?
Answer: The first step is to use a Cloud Security Scanner to surface known vulnerabilities and then work through those identified to remediate any issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the initial design not address security as part of its development process?
Answer: Because there are several important GCP vulnerability controls in place, such as built-in security within the network, HTTP Global Load Balancing, and default VPC configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the primary risk associated with hackers gaining access to sensitive user information?
Answer: The primary risk is that hackers could use the web servers as a launching pad for attacks on internal application servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do private IP addresses help in isolating upload web servers from public-facing webservers?
Answer: Private IP addresses require secondary NICs in the same private network as back-end servers, making it difficult for hackers to access the back-end servers directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the purpose of adding firewalls and firewall rules to restrict access to certain ports?
Answer: To restrict access to only certain ports and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do GCP's built-in security controls, such as HTTP Global Load Balancing and default VPC configurations, impact the need for additional security measures in the design?
Answer: While these controls provide some level of security, they are not sufficient on their own to address all potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to design flaws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the relationship between the use of private IP addresses and the implementation of auto-scaling for the front-end cluster?
Answer: Private IP addresses require secondary NICs in the same private network as back-end servers, which can be achieved by implementing auto-scaling to add additional servers to the front-end cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the assumption of implicit trust between components on the network impact the need for security accounts via IAM?
Answer: The assumption of implicit trust between components on the network means that there is no explicit control over access to sensitive areas, making it necessary to implement security accounts via IAM to ensure proper authorization and access control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some potential risks associated with not implementing auto-scaling for the front-end cluster?
Answer: Not implementing auto-scaling can leave the system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, as additional servers may be needed to absorb the attack and prevent it from taking down the entire system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do separate zones in the design impact the ability to isolate against fault tolerances?
Answer: Separate zones allow for isolation against fault tolerances, meaning that if one zone goes down, the others can continue to operate without affecting the overall system.</p>
