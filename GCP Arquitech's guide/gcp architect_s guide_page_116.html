        <pre><h1>Google Compute Engine Basics</h1>
<h2>Regions and Zones</h2>
<p>Google's proclivity for consistently deploying new hardware architectures may lead to different CPU architectures in different zones. This can result in a differential of up to three generations in processor types.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you need the latest high-end CPU or GPU, check the GCP website to see where those high-end processors have been deployed.</li>
<li>Hosting resources in another region and zone will not have a detrimental effect on latency and customer experience.</li>
<li>The billing perspective remains the same regardless of the individual CPU processor used.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Machine Types</h2>
<p>Selecting the right machine type is crucial for your application's performance. Consider factors such as CPU, memory, and storage when making your selection.</p>
<h3>Image Selection</h3>
<p>When creating a virtual machine, you will have the option to choose from various OS images. These images include the boot loader, operating system, file system structure, preconfigured software, libraries, tools, and customizations for the specific version.</p>
<h4>Public vs Custom Images</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can select either public or custom images.</li>
<li>Some images are premium (e.g., Windows OS Server) and have per-second charges, except for SQL Server images which are charged per minute.</li>
<li>Premium image prices vary with machine type but are global and do not change by region or zone.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Uploading Custom Images</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can upload and activate custom images on your VM.</li>
<li>This is ideal for licensed enterprise versions of Windows Server that have been customized with preconfigured software authorized for your organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disk Storage Management</h2>
<p>After selecting an OS image, you will need a persistent disk to store and boot from. Additionally, you must have a durable storage solution for your applications' data.</p>
<h3>Persistent Disks</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can use persistent disks to store and boot from.</li>
<li>Consider factors such as size, performance, and durability when choosing the right persistent disk for your application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cloud Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Storage is used to store OS images.</li>
<li>Images are stored as tar gzip'd files in a private area of Cloud Storage.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>However, there may be some other considerations such as Google's proclivity for consistently deploying new hardware architectures and these new hardware architectures are not deployed to all zones simultaneously.

Therefore, you're going to find that there are different CPU architectures in different zones. In fact, it has been noted that there can be a differential of up to three generations in those processor types. Of course this will only be a concern if you need the latest high end CPU or GPU for your processor intensive application. So you might want to check the GCP website to see where those high end processors have been deployed before choosing your region and zone.

Hosting your resources in another region and zone would have no detrimental effect from a latency and customer experience perspective, similarly from a billing perspective, you pay the exact same amount regardless of the type of individual CPU processor that you might be using. Google is constantly increasing the number of regions and zones and updating the supported CPU architecture. For an up to date list, go to cloud.google.com and search for regions and zones.

The next step after selecting the machine type and then the region/zone is to decide upon an OS image. When creating a virtual machine, just like when you commission server on-premises, you will have the option of choosing the boot OS disk image. This image just like any physical OS boot CD will include, the boot loader, the operating system, the file system structure, any preconfigured software, libraries, tools, and any other features and customizations for the specific version.

Furthermore, when you select an image from the drop-down menu in Compute Engine, the Google Cloud is included. These OS images are stored as tar gzip'd files, and are stored in a private area of Cloud Storage. Thus, when choosing an image, you can select either a public or custom image. And you can select from a wide choice of images, some of which will have a proprietary license so some of these images are premium images as indicated in parentheses with a 'p'. These images will have per second charges with the exception of SQL Server images, which are charged per minute.

Premium image prices vary with the machine type. However, these prices are global and do not vary by region or zone. Furthermore, you are advised - just like with any proprietary software - of the billing fees before you select and activate the OS image. You can also use upload and activate on your VM a custom image. For example, if you have a licensed enterprise version of Windows Server that you have customized with preconfigured software that's been authorized for your particular organization for use in your data centre then you can upload and then create a VM using that custom image.

You also have the option of importing images from another cloud provider.

So you have selected an OS image but that needs some kind of persistent disk where it can be stored and booted. You will also need to have somewhere to store your applications data and that needs to be durable and that means it can survive if the VM terminates.

        <pre><p><strong>Selecting a Region, Zone, and Operating System Image for Your Compute Engine Virtual Machine</strong></p>
<p>When creating a virtual machine in Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine, you'll need to consider several factors to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Architecture Considerations</strong>
Google frequently updates its hardware architectures, which may not be deployed simultaneously across all zones. This means that different CPU architectures can exist in different zones, with up to three generations of processor types available. If your application requires the latest high-end CPU or GPU, it's essential to check the GCP website for deployment information before selecting a region and zone.</p>
<p><strong>Latency and Customer Experience</strong>
Hosting resources in another region and zone will have no detrimental effect on latency and customer experience. Similarly, billing is unaffected by the type of individual CPU processor used.</p>
<p><strong>Operating System Images</strong>
When creating a virtual machine, you'll need to select an OS image from the drop-down menu in Compute Engine. These images are stored as tar gzip'd files in a private area of Cloud Storage. You can choose between public or custom images, with some premium images available for Windows Server and Linux. Premium images have per-second charges (except for SQL Server images), which vary by machine type but are global and do not depend on region or zone.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Images</strong>
You can also upload and activate a custom image, such as a licensed enterprise version of Windows Server customized with preconfigured software. Additionally, you can import images from another cloud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Disk Storage</strong>
After selecting an OS image, you'll need to choose a persistent disk for storage and booting. You'll also require durable storage for your applications data, which must survive if the VM terminates.</p></pre>
