        <pre>PROS
• 
• 
Compute Engine is intuitive and has a low learning curve, making it the most popular method.
You have almost total management and administrative control over your environment, allowing you to load any tools or third-party add-ons you want.

No need for public IPs, as Compute Engine provides private IP addresses by default.
You can run Docker containers using the container-Optimized OS, which simplifies deployment and management.

However, having total control also means that you must manage and control most aspects of your environment yourself, which can be complex.

More management overhead is required, as you need to handle tasks such as autoscaling, software installation, and maintenance.
Autoscaling in Compute Engine is slower than App Engine, and installing software on custom GCE instances can be difficult to maintain.

Chapter 9-Using GCP Cloud Tools

Google Cloud Development Tools
There are many popular third-party tools available for development, deployment, and monitoring that work natively with GCP. However, apart from the numerous open-source tools that come pre-installed, you also have access to the in-built tools tightly integrated with GCP.

In development and DevOps environments utilizing Cloud App Engine, managing code, libraries, and repositories often requires multiple tools for versioning, libraries, and source code trees. Many GCP customers use Git to store, distribute, and manage their code, either by running their own Git instances or using a hosted provider.

Cloud Source Repositories
Running your own Git instance provides total control over your code repository, but using a hosted provider may mean sacrificing some control. However, this can be mitigated by utilizing GCP's built-in methods for keeping code private within a project and implementing IAM permissions to protect access.

Alternatively, you can use the in-built tools provided by GCP, which offer a balance between control and ease of use.

        <pre><h3>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine and Cloud Development Tools</h3>
<h4>Pros of Using Compute Engine</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive and Low Learning Curve</strong>: This makes Compute Engine the most popular method.</li>
<li><strong>Total Management Control</strong>: You can load whatever tools or third-party add-ons you want, giving you almost total management and administrative control.</li>
<li><strong>No Need for Public IPs</strong>: You can run docker containers using the container-Optimized OS without needing public IPs.</li>
<li><strong>Total Control but Complex to Manage</strong>: As you have total control, it can be complex to manage and control as you have to do most things yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of Using Compute Engine</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Management Overhead</strong>: You need to handle most tasks yourself, which can be time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>Autoscaling Slower than App Engine</strong>: Autoscaling is slower in Compute Engine compared to App Engine.</li>
<li><strong>Installing Software on Custom GCE Instances Difficult</strong>: Installing software on custom GCE instances can be difficult to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Using Cloud Development Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Integration with GCP</strong>: There are many popular third-party tools for development, deployment, and monitoring that work natively in GCP.</li>
<li><strong>In-Built Tools Tightly-Integrated with GCP</strong>: You also have the option of using the in-built tools tightly-integrated with GCP.</li>
<li><strong>Managing Code, Libraries, and Repositories</strong>: In development and DevOps environments utilizing Cloud App Engine, you need to manage code, libraries, and repositories, often requiring multiple tools for versioning, libraries, and source code trees.</li>
<li><strong>Using Git for Code Management</strong>: Many GCP customers use the well-known repository Git to store, distribute, and manage their code. You can run your own Git instance or use a hosted Git provider.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cloud Source Repositories</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Running Your Own Git Instance</strong>: Running your own Git instance is great for managing a code repository because you have total control.</li>
<li><strong>Using a Hosted Git Provider</strong>: Using a hosted Git provider may mean some loss of control but it's less work. GCP provides its own way to keep code private to a GCP project and can use IAM permissions to protect access to it, without requiring maintenance of the Git instance itself.</li>
