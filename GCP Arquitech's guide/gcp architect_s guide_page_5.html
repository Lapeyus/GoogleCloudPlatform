        <pre><h1>The Evolution of Cloud Computing</h1>
<h2>Early Days of Virtualization (1990s-2000s)</h2>
<h3>Network Issues and Latency</h3>
<p>Network issues and latency brought about through traditional layer 3 routing made internet providers look towards Software Defined Networks (SDN) and a shift away from virtualization.</p>
<h2>The Rise of SDN and Container-Based Architecture</h2>
<h3>Internet-Scale Businesses Adopt SDN</h3>
<p>Large internet-scale businesses like Google understood that traditional networking and server architecture with virtualisation would not scale to their global demands. Consequently, they switched to a container-based architecture based upon an automated SDN elastic cloud built around automated services.</p>
<h2>Pioneers of Cloud Computing</h2>
<h3>Creating Own SDN Global Networks</h3>
<p>The pioneers of cloud computing such as Google didn't have a vendor roadmap to follow so they created their own SDN global networks and developed their own routers, switches and servers to meet their own world-wide criteria.</p>
<h2>Shared Resources and the Emergence of Cloud</h2>
<h3>Amazon's Realization</h3>
<p>What Amazon in particular realised early on was that their vast pool of resources could now be shared reliably, efficiently and cheaply over the internet just like co-location. This made colocation and in-house virtualisation a poor alternative as cloud became very attractive for small organizations.</p>
<h2>Software as a Service (SaaS) and Its Impact</h2>
<h3>Dislocating IT from Desktop Support</h3>
<p>The CRM platform Salesforce was one of the pioneers and it dislocated IT in many respects from desktop and application support. SaaS also instigated Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).</p>
<h2>IaaS and PaaS: A New Era for Cloud Computing</h2>
<h3>laaS and PaaS Offerings</h3>
<p>laaS provided raw compute, storage, and network services that are organized in ways that are far cheaper to provision and more efficient than on-premises servers. PaaS offerings were more suitable for developers that needed a platform on which to run their application code.</p>
<h2>Adoption of Cloud Computing: Challenges and Benefits</h2>
<h3>Larger Companies' Reticence</h3>
<p>Many larger companies thought that giving up control and management of their infrastructure was not an attractive proposition. However, the benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability and cost-effectiveness, eventually won over many organizations.</p></pre>

        <pre>The advent of the internet in the early 90's and its subsequent proliferation globally in the early 2000's made huge internet providers aware that virtualization was not a solution in itself as the ability to scale became paramount. Network issues and particularly latency brought about through traditional layer three routing made them look towards Software Defined Networks (SDN) and a shift away from virtualization towards SDN and container-based architecture.

As a result, these internet-scale businesses like Google understood that traditional networking and server architecture with virtualisation would not scale to their global demands. Consequently, large internet-scale organisations switched to a container-based architecture based upon an automated SDN elastic cloud built around automated services. With this model all the services are automatically proactively provisioned and seamlessly configured so that the infrastructure is optimized to run stacks, environments and popular applications.

But what was most important is that the pioneers of cloud computing such as Google when developing their revolutionary SDN networks didn't have a vendor roadmap to follow so they created their own SDN global networks and developed their own routers, switches and servers to meet their own world-wide criteria. Moreover, some of the pioneers realised that these new networks could support not just their own global ambitions and scope but also the requirements of others. What Amazon in particular realised early on was that their vast pool of resources could now be shared reliably, efficiently and cheaply over the internet just like co-location.

The Amazon cloud then made colocation and in-house virtualisation now a poor alternative as cloud became very attractive for small organisations that lacked their global scale. Further, around the late 2000's the cloud delivered a much easier way to manage applications through Software as a Service (SaaS). This way of delivering cloud-hosted software over the internet was fantastic as it disconnected on-premises technicians from being application experts.

Indeed, all you needed was a robust internet connection to benefit from an enterprise-class hosted software solution. The CRM platform Salesforce was one of the pioneers and it dislocated IT in many respects from desktop and application support. But SaaS was also the instigator of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) as these offerings soon followed.

IaaS provided raw compute, storage, and network services that are organised in ways that are far cheaper to provision and more efficient than on-premises servers. In contrast, PaaS offerings were more suitable for developers that needed a platform on which to run their application code. Moreover, PaaS provides developers with software libraries that give easy access to run-times, drivers and interfaces that run seamlessly on a transparent underlying managed infrastructure.

Whereas SaaS had been a huge success, the introduction of IaaS by cloud providers was met with far more reticence. Many larger companies thought that giving up control and management of their infrastructure was not an attractive proposition. Indeed, the larger organisations were already running their own version of the cloud via colocation in their large data centres. Hence, they didn't see any benefits of moving operations to the cloud all they saw was the potential hazards mainly regarding loss of control and security.
