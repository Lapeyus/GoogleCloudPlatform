        <pre>Stackdriver is the built-in GCP tool for monitoring, logging, and diagnostics, providing low-level tools that give access to various signals from infrastructure platforms, virtual machines, containers, middleware, and application tiers. By accessing system-level signals, it provides insight into an application's health, performance, and availability, allowing issues to be fixed before they escalate into serious problems.

The core components of Stackdriver include components responsible for detecting monitoring, logging, trace, error reporting, and debugging. Stackdriver monitoring checks the endpoints of web applications, as well as other internet-accessible services running on cloud environments. It allows configuration of uptime checks, which can be linked to specific URLs, groups, or resources, such as VM instances or load balancers.

Stackdriver also enables configuration of alerts based on interesting criteria, like health check failures or uptime checks that require immediate action. Furthermore, it can be combined with popular notification tools to create dashboards for visualizing application state. Stackdriver logging allows viewing logs from applications and filtering/searching them. It also lets define metrics based on log contents, incorporated into custom dashboards and alerts.

Logs can be exported to BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Pub/Sub. By incorporating Stackdriver into existing network management systems or Network Operation Centre software, it leverages in-depth error reporting to notify of new errors detected. It can also track, group, and categorize errors in applications.

Stackdriver trace proactively samples latency of App Engine applications and reports on per-URL statistics, notifying ahead of time of gradual degradation in specific services. When debugging code, a tedious method is to add logging statements. Stackdriver debugger reduces this drudgery by connecting production data to source code, allowing inspection of application state at any code location in production.

Stackdriver Debugger works best when application source code is available in Cloud Source repositories, although it can also work with other repository types. Anthos is an application management platform providing a consistent development, operations, and security experience for both cloud and on-premises environments. It's different from other public cloud services, being a fully software-based umbrella for multiple services aligned with themes of application modernization, cloud migration, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud management.
