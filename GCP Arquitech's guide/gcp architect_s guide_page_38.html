<p>Another important component of a VPC is it provides the critical 
internetworking between resources, such as VMs. It does this in a 
global and flexible way to ensure that all your cloud based 
resources and services can interact with one another. Thus a popular 
way to get started in GCP is through creating a VPC.</p>
<p>When you start out you can create the PVC inside your first GCP 
project, or you can simply choose the default VPC and use that. 
Regardless, your VPC provides the networking capabilities and services 
to connect your Google Cloud platform resources to each other and to the internet.</p>
<p>Basic Cloud Networking
Google's GCP provides you with the concept of the VPC which to all 
intent and purposes resembles your own private network. It also 
provides the underlying networking required to connect your cloud 
resources to each other and the internet. This networking service is 
typically automated and requires no intervention from you.</p>
<p>However if you like you can do many of the network tasks that you perform 
on your on-premises network such as you can segment your networks, use 
firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes 
to forward traffic to specific destinations. However there is a key 
difference between your on-premise networking and Google GCP networks.</p>
<p>Google's GCP is built upon a Software Defined Network which can be 
considered to be one vast layer-2 network with global reach. Thus the 
Virtual Private Cloud networks that you define will have global scope. 
This means that they can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide and 
importantly the subnets can span the zones that make up a region.</p>
<p>This architecture makes it easy for you to build redundancy into your 
design as there will be very low latency between resources in different 
zones as they are on the same subnet and communicating at layer-2 much 
like they were connected to the same switch. This is perfect for business 
continuity as a fallure in one zone can be addressed seamlessly by the 
resources in another zone.</p>
<p>Moreover the SDN architecture makes it easy to define your own network 
layout with a global scope as in addition to supporting resources in 
different zones on the same subnet, you can dynamically increase the size 
of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses 
allocated to it without affecting the already configured VMs.</p>
<p>In this example, your VPC has one network.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Google Cloud Platform Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a critical component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), providing global and flexible networking capabilities to connect cloud-based resources and services. It resembles a private network, offering automated networking with the ability to segment networks, use firewall rules, and create static routes.</p>
<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Scope</strong>: VPCs have a global scope, allowing subnets in any GCP region worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Zone Spanning</strong>: Subnets can span zones within a region, enabling low latency between resources in different zones.</li>
<li><strong>Business Continuity</strong>: Redundancy is built into the design, ensuring seamless addressing of failures in one zone by resources in another zone.</li>
<li><strong>SDN Architecture</strong>: The Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture makes it easy to define network layouts with global scope.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy Network Design</strong>: Define your own network layout with a global scope, supporting resources in different zones on the same subnet.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Subnet Size</strong>: Increase the size of a subnet by expanding IP address ranges without affecting already configured VMs.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Networking</strong>: Typically automated, requiring no intervention from you.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Creating a VPC</h4>
<p>You can create a VPC inside your first GCP project or choose the default VPC. Regardless, your VPC provides networking capabilities and services to connect Google Cloud platform resources to each other and to the internet.</p>
<h4>Regions and Zones</h4>
<p>VPCs are available in various regions, including US-West and US-East. Each region is composed of multiple zones, which can be spanned by subnets within a VPC.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>In this example, the VPC has one network.</p></pre>
