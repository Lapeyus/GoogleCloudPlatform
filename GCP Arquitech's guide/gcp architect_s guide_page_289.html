        <pre><h1>Incident Response</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Incident response is defined as the human behaviour that results in system stability when things don't go as planned.</p>
<h2>Importance of Consistency</h2>
<p>In responding to incidents, consistency is key. We need to minimize the frequency and duration of outage downtimes. Transparency about the root cause of the incident and sharing with others what we have done to fix it is crucial.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Consistency</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimizes downtime</li>
<li>Ensures transparency and communication</li>
<li>Allows team members to learn quickly from incidents</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a Structured Incident Response Policy</h2>
<p>To address consistency, we need to reduce duplication of effort. We can look to Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture for best practices.</p>
<h3>Key Principles of SRE Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration and communication</li>
<li>Learning and open source sharing of designs</li>
<li>Publishing best practices under open source via research.google.com and other blog posts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developing an Incident Response Policy</h2>
<p>We must treat our incident response policy in the same way as we consider business logic for our app. The process should be step-by-step, following a flow that includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information gathering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Notification of stakeholders and customers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Post-mortem analysis and documentation update</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Steps in the Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring service with alerting and dashboard</li>
<li>Notification of support on-call, stakeholders, and customers</li>
<li>Proactive planning for automated fail-over, auto-scale, or rollback mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
<p>Our business logic layer is where we start to work through our root cause analysis.</p>
<h3>Example Use Case</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incident response policy in place</li>
<li>Monitoring service with alerting and dashboard</li>
<li>Notification of stakeholders and customers</li>
<li>Post-mortem analysis and documentation update</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>Incident response is defined as the human behavior that results in system stability when things don't go as planned. After all, we've set up alerts, we're doing dashboards, and now we've got health checks, but how will we respond to an incident? In responding to incidents you will need to be consistent as you need to be able to minimize the frequency and the duration of those outage downtimes. You also need to be transparent about the root cause of the incident and share with others what you have done to fix it.

By sharing with the team what you have identified and how you responded lets them learn quickly from this outage. It is therefore imperative that you do so in a consistent and repeatable manner, and hence consequently we will want to create a structured incident response policy. This should result in the team being prepared, able to respond and fix rapidly as they will know what to do ahead of time.

To address consistency you will need to reduce the duplication of effort. We need to ensure that there is not multiple occurrences of the same thing going on which could delay our response. For a best practice we can look to Google and their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture. Within SRE the focus is on collaboration and communication, learning, open source and sharing of designs.

This culture is demonstrated by Google's willingness to publish best practices and anything they believe to be of value to the community under open source via the research.google.com site as well as through many other blog posts. In developing a strict incidence response policy we must treat it in the same way as we consider the business logic for our app, organized flow, step by step following a flow of information and subsequent customer notifications.

Therefore we must fully identify the flow and then put the steps in place to say this is our first level communication, this is our conclusion, then once we're back online you must take the time to follow up with a post-mortem, which will update the documentation. This typically involves three steps: monitoring service setup, notification of support on-call, stakeholders, and customers, and root cause analysis.

For the first step, we require a monitoring service with alerting as well as a dashboard and have the metrics in place to understand the scope of what has been affected. As we have already in place an alerting policy, the question now is how we are going to notify the support on-call, stakeholders, and customers. None of that can happen without you having planned the incident response policy and put in place the communication tools for responding to the issue.

However, you also have to consider if this needs to be done if you already have in place robust mechanisms for automated fail-over, auto-scale or even automated rollback mechanisms. Regardless, you will have to proactively put in place some method to prepare for these situations. Our business logic layer is where we start to work through our root cause analysis.

In developing a structured incident response policy, consistency and collaboration are key. By reducing duplication of effort and sharing knowledge, the team can respond more effectively to incidents and minimize downtime.

        <pre><h1><strong>Incident Response: A Structured Approach</strong></h1>
<p>Incident response refers to the human behavior that results in system stability when things don't go as planned. To achieve this, it's essential to have a consistent and repeatable approach to responding to incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Key Principles of Incident Response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency: Minimize frequency and duration of outage downtimes</li>
<li>Transparency: Share root cause of the incident and how it was fixed with others</li>
<li>Collaboration: Ensure team is prepared, able to respond, and fix rapidly</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Reducing Duplication of Effort</strong></h2>
<p>To address consistency, reduce duplication of effort by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring there's not multiple occurrences of the same thing going on</li>
<li>Following best practices from organizations like Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Developing a Structured Incident Response Policy</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Flow and Steps</strong>: Fully identify the flow and put steps in place for first-level communication, conclusion, and post-mortem.</li>
<li><strong>Determine Each Step's Address</strong>: Determine what each step will address, such as:<ul>
<li>Monitoring service with alerting and dashboard</li>
<li>Notification of support on-call, stakeholders, and customers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider Robust Mechanisms</strong>: Consider if existing mechanisms for automated fail-over, auto-scale, or automated rollback are in place.</li>
<li><strong>Proactively Prepare</strong>: Proactively put in place a method to prepare for these situations.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Business Logic Layer: Root Cause Analysis</strong></h2>

<p>Developing a structured incident response policy is crucial for consistency and transparency. It involves identifying the flow of events, creating a three-step process (notification, resolution, and post-mortem), and ensuring collaboration and communication among team members.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Collaboration and Communication in SRE Culture</h3>
<p>The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture at Google emphasizes collaboration, communication, learning, open source, and sharing designs. This approach is demonstrated through the publication of best practices and community engagement via research.google.com and other blog posts.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Business Logic Layer and Root Cause Analysis</h3>
<p>In the business logic layer, root cause analysis is conducted to identify the underlying issue causing the incident. This step is critical in developing an effective incident response policy and ensuring that the team can respond rapidly and efficiently.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Robust Mechanisms for Automated Fail-over and Rollback</h3>
<p>The presence of robust mechanisms for automated fail-over, auto-scale, or automated rollback may impact the need for a formal incident response policy. However, proactive planning is still necessary to prepare for such situations and ensure that the team can respond effectively.</p>
<h3>Topic 5: Notification and Communication with Stakeholders</h3>
<p>Effective notification and communication with stakeholders (support on-call, stakeholders, and customers) are essential in an incident response scenario. This involves having a clear plan in place for notifying these parties and ensuring that they receive timely and accurate information.</p></pre>
