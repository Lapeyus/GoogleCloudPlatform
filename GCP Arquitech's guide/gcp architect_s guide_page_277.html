<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In optimizing the network for pricing, you have to really understand how traffic flows across your network and where you're placing your data.</p>
<h3>Network Considerations</h3>
<p>You can save money on that multi-zone design by deploying Google's or a partners CDN service. Alternatively you could get a dedicated network interconnect to Google, either through a partner interconnect or private interconnect, which will save you also 50 percent on your cost.</p>
<p>Now if you're egressing between regions, that's going to have the same standard egress charges as well as intercontinental egress expensive charges. In fact, intercontinental can sometimes be a little bit more expensive.</p>
<h3>Capacity Planning</h3>
<p>The two of them together, capacity and pricing, provide another perspective on design options. You can modify the design for cost optimization or to limit resource usage. One important point is to apply dimensioning to your design after you've considered other functional aspects of the design.</p>
<h2>Use Case-28a Cost &amp; Sizing Scenario</h2>
<p>in this scenario we will consider that the annual capacity planning for the coming year's budgets have been completed. The report details the growing VM capacity requirements. Now you need to determine would it be better to choose a bigger capacity VM, or is sticking with the current size VM the most cost-effective? However, before you submit the capacity planning report, you want to see if you can taking a actually do some cost optimization. This means optimization analysis.</p>
<p>a closer look at the VM options and performing some cost Hence we will try and optimized for cost and capacity on our video transcription application. The focus is on VM sizing and performance. So we want to try and determine if moving the current upload instances which are n1-standard-1 to n1-standard-4, will provide the required capacity and at what cost.</p>
<h3>Network Throughput Efficiency</h3>
<p>Now thanks to our benchmarking we can see right away that there's some network throughput efficiency delivered by upgrading to four CPUs. Now from a network perspective that sounds great but is it cost effective, will we actually utilize this performance boost?</p>
<p>Therefore we need to check for the cost effectiveness of the VM upgrade of our peak of 576 servers.</p>
<h3>Network Considerations</h3>
<p>Don't forget the network? In optimizing the network for pricing, you have to really understand how traffic flows across your network and where you're placing your data. For instance if you going for resiliency and availability and have a multi zone design, which is best practices , there are charges on the egress traffic between the multiple zones within the same region.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Determine the current network configuration</h2>
<p>To optimize our video transcription application's performance and cost, we first need to understand our current network configuration. This includes identifying the number of servers, their locations, and any existing network infrastructure such as firewalls or load balancers.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Assess the current egress traffic charges</h2>
<p>Next, we should assess our current egress traffic charges. This will help us identify areas where we can optimize our costs by reducing unnecessary data transfer between regions.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Evaluate the benefits of upgrading to a larger VM size</h2>
<p>We need to evaluate whether upgrading to a larger VM size (e.g., from n1-standard-1 to n1-standard-4) would provide sufficient capacity for our application's requirements. This will help us determine if the increased cost is justified by the potential performance improvements.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Research alternative network optimization options</h2>
<p>We should research alternative network optimization options, such as deploying a content delivery network (CDN) or using a dedicated network interconnect to Google. These options may provide additional cost savings and improved performance.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Calculate the total cost of ownership for each option</h2>
<p>Once we have evaluated our current configuration, assessed egress traffic charges, evaluated VM size upgrades, and researched alternative optimization options, we can calculate the total cost of ownership (TCO) for each scenario. This will help us determine which option is most cost-effective.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Choose the optimal solution based on TCO analysis</h2>
<p>After calculating the TCO for each option, we can choose the solution that provides the best balance between performance and cost. This may involve a combination of upgrading VM sizes, optimizing egress traffic charges, and implementing alternative network optimization strategies.</p>
<p>The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$</p></pre>

Now if you're egressing between regions, that's going to have the same standard egress charges as well as intercontinental egress expensive charges. In fact, intercontinental can sometimes be a little bit more costly.

In this chapter, you learned about capacity planning, including the planning cycle, and you learned about GCP discounts. The two of them together, capacity and pricing, provide another perspective on design options. You can modify the design for cost optimization or to limit resource usage. One important point is to apply dimensioning to your design after you've considered other functional aspects of the design.

Use Case-28a Cost & Sizing Scenario

In this scenario, we will consider that the annual capacity planning for the coming year's budgets have been completed. The report details the growing VM capacity requirements. Now you need to determine whether it would be better to choose a bigger capacity VM or stick with the current size VM, which is the most cost-effective?

However, before submitting the capacity planning report, you want to see if you can do some cost optimization. This means performing an optimization analysis.

A closer look at the VM options and performing some cost optimization will help us determine if moving the current upload instances from n1-standard-1 to n1-standard-4 will provide the required capacity and at what cost.

We have to consider whether we can optimize these upload servers by reducing the quantity and increasing the number of cores. For the sake of argument, let's say that the current en1-standard-1 has one VCPU and runs upload VMs with a performance of an n1-standard-1 coming in at 1.4 Gbps.

Our Perfkit Benchmark indicates that the current standard-4 is 6.1 Gbps. Furthermore, our monitoring of the upload VMs shows that the highest number used was about 576 machines, so we use that as our standard.

Now, thanks to our benchmarking, we can see right away that there's some network throughput efficiency delivered by upgrading to four CPUs. However, from a network perspective, that sounds great, but is it cost-effective? Will we actually utilize this performance boost?

Therefore, we need to check for the cost effectiveness of the VM upgrade of our peak of 576 servers.

        <pre><h3>Optimizing Network and Cost for Pricing in GCP</h3>
<p>To optimize your network for pricing in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it's essential to understand how traffic flows across your network and where you're placing your data.</p>
<h4>Multi-Zone Design and Egress Traffic Charges</h4>
<p>A multi-zone design is a best practice for resiliency and availability, but it comes with charges on egress traffic between zones within the same region. You can save money by deploying Google's CDN service or getting a dedicated network interconnect to GCP, which will save you 50% on your cost.</p>
<h4>Egress Between Regions</h4>
<p>Egressing between regions incurs standard egress charges as well as intercontinental egress charges, which can be expensive. Intercontinental egress can sometimes be more costly than standard egress.</p>
<h4>Capacity Planning and Pricing</h4>
<p>Capacity planning and pricing provide another perspective on design options. You can modify your design for cost optimization or to limit resource usage by applying dimensioning after considering other functional aspects of the design.</p>
<h3>Use Case: Cost &amp; Sizing Scenario</h3>
<p>In this scenario, you need to determine whether it's better to choose a bigger capacity VM or stick with the current size VM for your video transcription application. Before submitting the capacity planning report, you want to perform cost optimization analysis.</p>
<p>You'll consider optimizing your upload servers by reducing quantity and increasing number of cores. For example, you can upgrade from n1-standard-1 to n1-standard-4, which provides better performance but also incurs additional costs.</p>
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Network throughput efficiency: Upgrading to four CPUs delivers better network throughput, but is it cost-effective?</li>
<li>Cost effectiveness: Will you actually utilize the performance boost of upgrading your peak of 576 servers?</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering these factors and applying dimensioning to your design, you can optimize your VM sizing and performance while minimizing costs.</p></pre>
