VM Security

When contemplating security issues with VMs, it is essential to remember that the creator of a VM has full root privileges instance. For example, if considering a Linux VM, the creator will have SSH capability and can then use the GCP console to grant SSH capability to other users. Similarly, when creating a VM using a Windows OS, the creator can use the GCP console to generate a username and password. After that, anyone who knows the username and password can connect to the VM's OS using a remote desktop protocol or RDP client.

A point to remember is that if you are using the default network type listed, then you don't need to define any firewall rules to allow access to the VM. However, if you are using manual or custom network types, you will have to add the required firewall rules for both SSH and RDP in order to allow access to the instance.

IAM Roles

Granular control over the permissions that you can give a project is provided when using IAM with Compute Engine. This gives you very fine-grained control over user, group, or resource permissions. Indeed, every API method in Compute Engine will require that the identity making the API request does have the prerequisite privileges to use the Compute Engine resource.

Privileges take the form of permissions, which you can grant to others by setting an IAM policy. The purpose of the IAM policy is to grant roles to a member (user, group, or service account) of your project in a consistent and reproducible manner.

In addition to legacy roles (viewer, editor, owner), and custom roles that you can configure yourself, there are Compute Engine predefined roles. Predefined roles are normally sufficient for most projects as they have more granularity than primitive roles and are more convenient to use than custom roles.

Indeed, predefined roles allow you to grant multiple roles to a project member on the same resource, which provides a large measure of flexibility. For example, if you want to give an admin full control of all Compute Engine resources, you could give a user roles/compute.admin. However, you want to be only providing permissions on the least required principles so you may want to select a role that serves more specific job functions.

Compute Engine has many specific predefined roles such as:

• roles/compute.instanceAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances. This includes permissions to create, modify, and delete disks.
• roles/compute.load BalancerAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associate resources.
• roles/compute.networkAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates.

However, if you are using manual or custom network types, you will have to add the required firewall rules for both SSH and RDP in order to allow access to the instance.

IAM Roles

Granular control over the permissions that you can give a project is provided when using IAM with Compute Engine. This gives you very fine-grained control over user, group, or resource permissions. Indeed, every API method in Compute Engine will require that the identity making the API request does have the prerequisite privileges to use the Compute Engine resource.

Privileges take the form of permissions, which you can grant to others by setting an IAM policy. The purpose of the IAM policy is to grant roles to a member (user, group, or service account) of your project in a consistent and reproducible manner.

In addition to legacy roles (viewer, editor, owner), and custom roles that you can configure yourself, there are Compute Engine predefined roles. Predefined roles are normally sufficient for most projects as they have more granularity than primitive roles and are more convenient to use than custom roles.

Indeed, predefined roles allow you to grant multiple roles to a project member on the same resource, which provides a large measure of flexibility. For example, if you want to give an admin full control of all Compute Engine resources, you could give a user roles/compute.admin. However, you want to be only providing permissions on the least required principles so you may want to select a role that serves more specific job functions.

Compute Engine has many specific predefined roles such as:

• roles/compute.instanceAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances. This includes permissions to create, modify, and delete disks.
• roles/compute.load BalancerAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associate resources.
• roles/compute.networkAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates.

For those wanting to try out Compute Engine, there are also free usage limits. These free usage quotas provide one fl-micro instance, with up to 30 gigabytes of HDD persistent disk and up to one gigabyte of network egress traffic, per month. At the other end of the usage spectrum, there are more attractive discounts for VM usage when you purchase committed use discounts.

VM Security

When contemplating security issues with VMs, it is essential to remember that the creator of a VM has full root privileges instance. For example, if considering a Linux VM, the creator will have SSH capability and can then use the GCP console to grant SSH capability to other users. Similarly, when creating a VM using a Windows OS, the creator can use the GCP console to generate a username and password. After that, anyone who knows the username and password can connect to the VM's OS using a remote desktop protocol or RDP client.

A point to remember is that if you are using the default network type listed, then you don't need to define any firewall rules to allow access to the VM.

For example, if you want to give an admin full control of all Compute Engine resources, you could give a user roles/compute.admin. However, you want to be only providing permissions on the least required principles so you may want to select a role that serves more specific job functions.

Compute Engine has many specific predefined roles such as:

• roles/compute.instanceAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances. This includes permissions to create, modify, and delete disks.
• roles/compute.load BalancerAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associate resources.
• roles/compute.networkAdmin - Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certificates.

For those wanting to try out Compute Engine, there are also free usage limits. These free usage quotas provide one fl-micro instance, with up to 30 gigabytes of HDD persistent disk and up to one gigabyte of network egress traffic, per month. At the other end of the usage spectrum, there are more attractive discounts for VM usage when you purchase committed use discounts.

VM Security

When contemplating security issues with VMs, it is essential to remember that the creator of a VM has full root privileges instance. For example, if considering a Linux VM, the creator will have SSH capability and can then use the GCP console to grant SSH capability to other users. Similarly, when creating a VM using a Windows OS, the creator can use the GCP console to generate a username and password. After that, anyone who knows the username and password can connect to the VM's OS using a remote desktop protocol or RDP client.

A point to remember is that if you are using the default network type listed, then you don't need to define any firewall rules to allow access to the VM. However, if you are using manual or custom network types, you will have to add the required firewall rules for both SSH and RDP in order to allow access to the instance.

IAM Roles

Granular control over the permissions that you can give a project is provided when using IAM with Compute Engine. This gives you very fine-grained control over user, group, or resource permissions. Indeed, every API method in Compute Engine will require that the identity making the API request does have the prerequisite privileges to use the Compute Engine resource.

Privileges take the form of permissions, which you can grant to others by setting an IAM policy. The purpose of the IAM policy is to grant roles to a member (user, group, or service account) of your project in a consistent and reproducible manner.

In addition to legacy roles (viewer, editor, owner), and custom roles that you can configure yourself, there are Compute Engine predefined roles. Predefined roles are normally sufficient for most projects as they have more granularity than primitive roles and are more convenient to use than custom roles.
