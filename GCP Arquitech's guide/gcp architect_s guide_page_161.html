        <pre><h1>Cloud Router with Subnetworks</h1>
<h2>Use Case</h2>
<p>If you are a developer working within your organisations VPC and you want to spin up a new environment for the purpose of analytics. When you create the resources within that environment they will interconnect over a network that will use a new subnet range.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Now you can connect to it fine as you are connecting through GCP but how will others in your organisation connect to your new dashboards as it on a newly created subnet.
Well you could update every router in the on-premise network with a static route to the new subnet or you could use cloud router to advertise the subnet for you.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Cloud router will advertise the subnet through its peering arrangement with a remote neighbour on the on-premise peering network.
Cloud router's BGP protocol will announce to its neighbour that the new subnet is now available . Then the neighbour BGP router on- premise, will update its routing tables and any of its peer's so that all internal on-premises routers will now know how to get to this new allocated subnet. Now any departments that want to access your new analytics dashboards can do so.</p>
<h2>Importance</h2>
<p>Importantly this process works in both directions so if your data centre adds a new w physical rack and it goes online with a new range of subnets, the VPC resources will need to know about them.
This is because any hosts on this new range of subnets will be able to reach your new analytics dashboard okay but the VPC network will not know how to return the traffic as it knows nothing about the new range of subnets. However with cloud router the on-premises BGP process will discover the new range of subnets and it will tell the BGP neighbour on the cloud side that a new network exists. Now they will have a route to return traffic from that new range of subnets.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>As Cloud Router uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to dynamically exchange routes between your Virtual Private Cloud network and your on-premises network you will need to configure an interface and a BGP peer for your on-premises router.
The interface and BGP peer configuration together form a BGP session. However, when configuring BGP you must stipulate an autonomous system number; this is a unique BGP identifier for the organization.</p>
<h2>Types of ASN</h2>
<p>There are two types of ASN:
- A public ASN is unique like IP addresses and are registered to your organization so if you already have a public ASN you are likely running BGP on your routers already.
- A private ASN, which like private IP addresses are only unique within the organization and so are not valid on the internet. Fortunately, you can use a private ASN within private networks such as when operation a VPN connection.</p>
<h2>GCP Resources</h2>
<p>Within GCP, a Cloud Router interface connects to exactly one of the following GCP resources:
• A traditional VPN tunnel that is using dynamic routing (you use a private ASN)
• A HA (High Availability) VPN tunnel that will be using dynamic routing (you use a private ASN)</p></pre>

        <pre>We can demonstrate the benefit of using Cloud Router with subnetworks through a use case. If you are a developer working within your organisation's VPC and you want to spin up a new environment for the purpose of analytics, when you create the resources within that environment they will interconnect over a network that will use a new subnet range.

Now you can connect to it fine as you are connecting through GCP but how will others in your organisation connect to your new dashboards as it on a newly created subnet.

Then the neighbour BGP router on-premise, will update its routing tables and any of its peer's so that all internal on-premises routers will now know how to get to this new allocated subnet. Now any departments that want to access your new analytics dashboards can do so.

        <pre><h1><strong>Using Cloud Router with Subnetworks for Seamless Connectivity</strong></h1>
<p>When creating a new environment within an organization's VPC for analytics, it's essential to consider how others in the organization can connect to the new dashboards. One approach is to update every router in the on-premise network with static routes to the new subnet. However, this can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
<p>A more efficient solution is to use Cloud Router, which advertises the new subnet through its peering arrangement with a remote neighbor on the on-premise peering network. This process works by announcing the new subnet to the neighboring BGP router, which updates its routing tables and shares the information with other internal on-premises routers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Router enables seamless connectivity between the VPC and on-premise networks.</li>
<li>The process works in both directions, ensuring that both incoming and outgoing traffic can be routed correctly.</li>
<li>This approach eliminates the need for manual static route updates, reducing administrative overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configuring BGP with Autonomous System Numbers</strong></p>
<p>To configure Cloud Router, you'll need to stipulate an autonomous system number (ASN), which is a unique identifier for your organization. There are two types of ASNs: public and private. Public ASNs are registered with your organization and are valid on the internet, while private ASNs are only unique within the organization and are not valid on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>GCP Cloud Router Interface Options</strong></p>
<p>Within GCP, a Cloud Router interface connects to one of the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>A traditional VPN tunnel using dynamic routing (private ASN)</li>
<li>An HA (High Availability) VPN tunnel using dynamic routing (private ASN)</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging Cloud Router with subnetworks, organizations can establish seamless connectivity between their VPC and on-premise networks, ensuring efficient data exchange and reduced administrative complexity.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Cloud Router Configuration and BGP Protocol</h3>
<p>Cloud router configuration involves setting up an interface and a BGP peer for the on-premises router, forming a BGP session. The autonomous system number (ASN) must be stipulated to identify the organization.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Benefits of Using Cloud Router with Subnetworks</h3>
<p>Using cloud router allows organizations to advertise new subnets to their on-premise networks, enabling departments to access new analytics dashboards. This process works in both directions, ensuring that VPC resources and hosts on new subnets can communicate effectively.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and BGP Configuration</h3>
<p>There are two types of ASNs: public and private. Public ASNs are unique like IP addresses and registered to the organization, while private ASNs are only valid within the organization's private networks. Cloud router uses dynamic routing with a private ASN for VPN connections.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: GCP Resources and Cloud Router Interfaces</h3>
<p>Cloud router interfaces connect to traditional VPN tunnels using dynamic routing or HA (High Availability) VPN tunnels also using dynamic routing.</p></pre>

</ol>
<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose you want to spin up a new environment for analytics within your VPC. How would you use Cloud Router to connect it to your on-premises network?

</li>
<li>
<p>How would you handle the addition of a new range of subnets in a data center when it goes online with a new physical rack?
Answer: You would configure an interface and BGP peer for your on-premises router using a private ASN, stipulating an ASN, and then use the Cloud Router's BGP protocol to announce the new subnet to its neighbor on the cloud side.</p>
