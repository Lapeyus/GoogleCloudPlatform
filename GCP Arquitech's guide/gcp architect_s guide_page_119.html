        <pre><h1>Cloud Persistent Disks</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud Persistent Disks provide a managed, cloud-persistent storage solution for virtual machines (VMs) in Google Compute Engine.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redundancy</strong>: Data is automatically replicated across multiple zones within a region.</li>
<li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Data at rest is encrypted using standard encryption keys provided by GCP. </li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>: Disks can be resized as needed, and management of the disks is handled on the backend.</li>
<li><strong>Decryption Keys</strong>: Users have control over decryption keys, ensuring that only authorized parties can access data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3>1. Data Backup</h3>
<p>Snapshots are useful for periodic backups of data on persistent disks. They provide incremental backups, which means they backup only the data that has changed since the last snapshot. This approach is faster and cheaper than creating a full image of the disk.</p>
<h3>2. Disk Upgrades</h3>
<p>Snapshots can be used to transfer data from one type of disk to another (e.g., from standard HDD to SSD). This allows for easier upgrades without losing data.</p>
<h3>3. Data Migration</h3>
<p>Snapshots enable easy migration of data between zones within a region or across regions. This is particularly useful when moving VMs between different zones or regions.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Before taking a disk snapshot, it's recommended to freeze or unmount the file system to ensure snapshot consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Users should manage their own decryption keys to maintain control over data access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Automating Disk Migrations</h3>
<p>Compute Engine provides the <code>gcloud</code> command-line tool for automating VM migrations, including disk transfers using snapshots.</p></pre>

On the other hand, with cloud-persistent disks all the management devices. Also, redundancy and data encryption on disks are resize the file system at will as the disks are virtual network performed automatically and the keys managed by GCP. However, if responsibility for managing the decryption keys that is risky but it will ensure that no party - even Google - can get to the data except you want you can use your own keys. You then have the flexibility to manage your data.

We briefly mentioned earlier that Compute Engine can help you automate the migration of VMs between zones within a region. This is a pretty common occurrence and if you move your VM instance between zones within the same region, you can simply use the gcloud, 'move' command for the specified VM instance. However, if you should want to move your instance to a different zone in a different region, then this cannot be automated. In this scenario, you will need to manually move the VM. This is not difficult but it does require carefully following the procedure as you need to be careful how you move the VM's persistent drive's data to the new drive in the destination zone.

This procedure involves some handy features with cloud-persistent drives such as making a snapshot of all the attached persistent disks. You can then create some new disks in the destination region, and move the data across regions using that snapshot. The next step is to create the new VM in the destination region and then attach the new persistent disks.

Snapshots are very handy features that have several other use cases. For example, they can be used to backup critical data into a durable storage solution to meet your organization's business continuity requirements. These snapshots can then be stored in cloud storage, for data recovery purposes. Snapshots can also be used to simply transfer data from one zone to another.

For instance, you might want to minimize latency by migrating data to a drive that can be locally attached in the zone where it is used. Another common snapshot use case is when transferring data to a different disk type. For example, if you want to improve disk performance, by upgrading from standard HDD to faster persistent SSDs, then you could simply transfer data from a standard HDD persistent disk to an SSD persistent disk using a snapshot of the data.

A caveat that you should be aware of is that snapshots are available only to persistent disks and not to local SSDs. Snapshots are also very useful for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disk as they are incremental and automatically compressed. This means they are perfect for doing traditional incremental backups of data on a persistent disk.

As snapshots are incremental backups, they are faster as they only backup data that has changed since the last snapshot. Also, if used regularly, backups by snapshots will be much quicker and cheaper than making a full image of the disk. However, it's essential to understand that snapshots are not the same thing as public images and custom images, which are used primarily to create VM instances or configure VM instance templates.

Before taking a disk snapshot, you should freeze or unmounting the file system. This is not strictly necessary as you can take a snapshot of a persistent disk even while your applications write data to that disk. But it's the most reliable way to ensure snapshot consistency.

        <pre><p><strong>Cloud Persistent Disks and Snapshots: A Comprehensive Guide</strong></p>
<p>Cloud persistent disks provide a convenient way to manage storage for virtual machines (VMs) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). With cloud-persistent disks, you can expand disks and resize file systems at will, as the management devices are handled on the backend. Additionally, redundancy and data encryption on disks are performed automatically by GCP.</p>
<p>However, if you want to manage decryption keys yourself, it's essential to understand that this comes with risks. On the other hand, using your own keys ensures that no party, including Google, can access your data except when you want them to.</p>
<p><strong>Automating VM Migrations</strong></p>
<p>Compute Engine can help automate the migration of VMs between zones within a region. If you move your VM instance between zones within the same region, you can use the <code>gcloud</code> command to perform the migration. However, if you need to move your instance to a different zone in a different region, manual intervention is required.</p>
<p>To perform this task, you'll need to create a snapshot of all attached persistent disks, create new disks in the destination region, and then transfer data across regions using that snapshot. The next step is to create a new VM in the destination region and attach the new persistent disks.</p>
<p><strong>Snapshots: A Handy Feature</strong></p>
<p>Snapshots are a handy feature with several use cases. They can be used to backup critical data into a durable storage solution to meet business continuity requirements. Snapshots can also be used to transfer data from one zone to another, minimize latency by migrating data to locally attached drives, and improve disk performance by transferring data to faster persistent SSDs.</p>
<p>Snapshots are incremental backups that only capture changes since the last snapshot, making them faster and more efficient than full disk images. However, it's essential to understand that snapshots are not the same as public images or custom images, which are used primarily to create VM instances or configure templates.</p>
<p>Before taking a disk snapshot, it's recommended to freeze or unmount the file system to ensure snapshot consistency. This is not strictly necessary, but it provides the most reliable way to achieve this goal.</p></pre>
