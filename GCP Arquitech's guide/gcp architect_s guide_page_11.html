        <pre><h1>Cloud-Native Architecture</h1>
<h2>Principles of Good Architectural Design</h2>
<h3>Similarities with Traditional Infrastructure</h3>
<p>What we actually will find 
is that the cloud is not much different
is made of the 
same fabric of servers, disks and networks that makes up 
traditional infrastructure. This means that almost all 
of
the principles of good 
architectural design still apply for cloud-
native architecture.</p>
<h2>Non-Functional Aspects</h2>
<p>While many of the functional aspects remain the same regardless a to on-premises or cloud  the latter is often more challenging  when it comes to the non- functional aspects. These do often result in design constraints. Indeed,  some of the fundamental  assumptions about  how the infrastructure fabric performs do change when you're in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Speed and Flexibility</h3>
<p>The differences are in speed and flexibility. For instance, provisioning a replacement server can take weeks  in traditional environments, even in VM environments it still takes a day, whereas in the cloud, it takes seconds. Hence in the cloud it's much easier to provision a full application stack with fully automated scaling and fail-over scenarios than on-premises.</p>
<h2>Requirements for Cloud-Native Architecture</h2>
<p>However in order to take advantage of these properties it is a requirement that the cloud provider has many application and vendor partners. To this end Google Cloud Platform support a very large partner network, which allows you to provision both proprietary and open source solutions with a single click via the Cloud Launcher service.</p>
<h2>Key Characteristics of Cloud-Native Architecture</h2>
<p>Google's SDN network facilitates a cloud-native design, which also tends to focus on key metrics such as resilience, horizontal scaling, distributed processing, and automation. So we need to take these characteristics into account when you are evaluating other cloud- native architectures that are not based on Google's own SDN cloud
network.</p>
<h2>Google Cloud Platform Architecture</h2>
<p>The Google Cloud Platform is organized as a software defined network, now that might sound confusing but it's not really and we will consider the architecture later in some detail. But for now all you need to know is that Google's global network is defined by segments and its smallest entity is a Zone, which can be defined as a deployment area for Google Cloud Platform Resources.</p>
<h3>Zones</h3>
<p>It could be simplified to mean a data centre but that is not always the case as a zone could have several points of presence within a local zone. However a zone works as one large switch operating within a common subnet so entities within a zone communicate at layer-2 or the Ethernet data layer - which we will cover later - but it means latency is minimal and configuration negligible.</p>
<h3>Selecting Local Zones</h3>
<p>When you launch a virtual machine for example, in a GCP zone using Compute Engine, you will be prompted to select a local zone. This is the local area where you wish the application or service to run. Hence you would select the closest zone to where you want the application or service to run. This will ensure that the associated compute, storage and network resources are local and close to the area they serve to deliver low latency and high performance.</p>
<h3>Redundancy and Business Continuity</h3>
<p>However zones, as we have seen, can be large geographical areas that contain several data centres which are many kilometres apart and this allows for a measure of redundancy and business continuity planning. For instance you could mirror your infrastructure across two zones perhaps 100 km apart to give you a measure of mitigation for disaster recovery or business continuity should one zone's data centre suffer a natural catastrophe.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Cloud-Native Architecture: A Synthesis</h3>
<p>The cloud is not significantly different from traditional on-premises data centers in terms of its underlying infrastructure, comprising servers, disks, and networks. As such, the principles of good architectural design still apply to cloud-native architecture.</p>
<p>However, the non-functional aspects of the cloud often result in design constraints. The differences in speed and flexibility are notable, with provisioning a replacement server taking seconds in the cloud compared to weeks or days in traditional environments. This enables easier application stack provisioning with automated scaling and fail-over scenarios.</p>
<p>To take advantage of these properties, it is essential that the cloud provider has a large partner network, which Google Cloud Platform (GCP) supports through its Cloud Launcher service. This allows for easy provisioning of both proprietary and open-source solutions.</p>
<h3>Key Characteristics of GCP's SDN Network</h3>
<p>GCP's software-defined network (SDN) facilitates a cloud-native design focused on key metrics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience</li>
<li>Horizontal scaling</li>
<li>Distributed processing</li>
<li>Automation</li>
</ul>
<p>When evaluating other cloud-native architectures, it is crucial to consider these characteristics.</p>
<h3>Understanding GCP's Zone-Based Architecture</h3>
<p>GCP's global network is defined by segments, with the smallest entity being a <strong>Zone</strong>. A zone can be thought of as a deployment area for Google Cloud Platform resources and may not always correspond to a single data center. However, zones operate as one large switch within a common subnet, ensuring minimal latency and negligible configuration.</p>
<p>When launching a virtual machine using Compute Engine, users are prompted to select a local zone, which determines the location of the associated compute, storage, and network resources. This ensures low latency and high performance for applications or services running in that zone.</p>
<p>Zones can also be large geographical areas containing multiple data centers, allowing for redundancy and business continuity planning. For instance, mirroring infrastructure across two zones 100 km apart provides a measure of mitigation for disaster recovery or business continuity in case one zone's data center suffers a natural catastrophe.</p></pre>
