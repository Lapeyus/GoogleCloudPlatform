        <pre><h1>Metrics and Scaling</h1>
<h2>Understanding Custom Metrics</h2>
<p>The purpose of custom metrics is to get a Deployment to scale its replicated Pods based on the given metric value. However, metrics with a total target value should always be defined only when the effects of the scaling will bring the updated value of the metric closer to the target value.</p>
<h2>Scaling a Frontend Application</h2>
<p>We can see this better by considering how we might go about scaling a frontend application. We could do this by choosing a custom metric based on the queries-per-second metric. Thus, we are expecting that when the metric value increases, the number of Pods should scale up, with each Pod serving a similar amount of traffic as before.</p>
<h2>Importance of Average vs Total Value</h2>
<p>However, if we had exported from each pod the total number of queries-per-second and then set instead of an average but a total target value for this metric, it will not work as we hoped. This is because increasing the number of Pods doesn't have any effect on the total traffic value so the HPA will not scale the deployment based upon that metric.</p>
<h2>Use Case - High Performance Computing</h2>
<p>A University comes to you seeking your advice as how to run an High Performance Computing analytics project on a vast internet-based dataset. It is a collaborative project and the application is being shared across several participating Universities.</p>
<h2>Solution Overview</h2>
<p>The place to start is if their application is in container technology already, then they could look for a highly scalable architecture based Kubernetes Engine clusters with auto scale and pre-emptive upon VMs.</p></pre>

        <pre>The metrics that you use can have unexpected results so you must be aware as to how they work in practice. This is important because the metrics are not always intuitive.

For example, the purpose of a custom metric is to get a Deployment to scale its replicated Pods based on the given metric value. However, metrics with a total target value should always be defined only when the effects of the scaling will bring the updated value of the metric closer to the target value.

We can see this better by considering how we might go about scaling a frontend application. We could do this by choosing a custom metric based on the queries-per-second metric. Thus, we are expecting that when the metric value increases, the number of Pods should scale up, with each Pod serving a similar amount of traffic as before.

Now, we could go about this by exporting from each pod the queries-per-second value and setting a desired target average value results. This results in the desired behavior that we are looking for. However, if we had exported from each pod the total number of queries-per-second and then set instead of an average but a total target value for this metric, it will not work as we hoped.

This is because increasing the number of Pods doesn't have any effect on the total traffic value so the HPA will not scale the deployment based upon that metric.

Use Case - 20a

A University comes to you seeking your advice as how to run an High Performance Computing analytics project on a vast internet-based dataset. It is a collaborative project and the application is being shared across several participating Universities. They do not have the on-premises infrastructure to host such a project so would like to host it in the cloud as then they could share the access and the costs.

The application that they have developed in-house has a processing and an analytical function but it has already been ported to Docker containers for portability between partner Universities. The problem is that they have a limited grant so funds are tight, but they also don't know where to start? How can you help them?

Solution

The place to start is if their application is in container technology already then they could look for a highly scalable architecture based on Kubernetes Engine clusters with auto scale and pre-emptive upon VMs.

        <pre><p>Metrics used in practice can have unexpected results, so it's essential to understand how they work. Custom metrics are not always intuitive and should be defined only when scaling will bring the updated value closer to a target value.</p>
<p>For example, consider scaling a frontend application based on queries-per-second (qps) metric. By exporting qps values from each pod and setting a desired average target value, the deployment can scale up with each pod serving similar traffic. However, if the total number of qps is used instead of an average, increasing the number of pods will not affect the total traffic value, making it ineffective for scaling.</p>
<p>To address this issue, use metrics that are relevant to the specific use case and consider the effects of scaling on the metric's target value. In the context of a High Performance Computing analytics project, a collaborative application shared across multiple universities can benefit from a scalable architecture based on Kubernetes Engine clusters with auto-scale and pre-emptive VMs.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom metrics should be defined to bring the updated value closer to a target value when scaling.</li>
<li>Metrics like queries-per-second (qps) require careful consideration of their relevance and how they affect scaling.</li>
<li>A highly scalable architecture based on Kubernetes Engine clusters with auto-scale and pre-emptive VMs can address scalability challenges in High Performance Computing analytics projects.</li>
