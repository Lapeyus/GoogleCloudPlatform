<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring">Stackdriver Monitoring API</a></li>
<li>Metrics Explorer: view metrics related to services</li>
<li>Custom dashboards and alerts for monitoring services over time</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">Stackdriver Logging API</a></li>
<li>Logs viewer: view logs in Stackdriver</li>
<li>Export logs to BigQuery (may incur additional costs)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tracing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/trace">Stackdriver Trace API</a></li>
<li>Distributed tracing for performance bottlenecks</li>
<li>Instrument tracing headers in workloads</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>
<p>The Istio installation also lets you add the Istio sidecar proxy (Envoy) to your service workloads, allowing them to communicate with the control plane and join the Istio mesh. However, for clusters with Stackdriver enabled, the Istio Stackdriver adapter is installed along with the core components described above.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tight coupling between Istio and Stackdriver ensures data is sent from service mesh to Stackdriver console by default</li>
<li>Enable a particular Stackdriver feature for your project and cluster to get required observability into services' behaviour</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>The installation also lets you add the Istio sidecar proxy (Envoy) to your service workloads, allowing them to communicate with the control plane and join the Istio mesh. However, for clusters with Stackdriver enabled, the Istio Stackdriver adapter is installed along with the core components described above. The Istio adapter then sends metrics, logging, telemetry and trace data from the Istio service mesh into Stackdriver.

This integration provides the required observability into your services' behaviour, which is visible in the Stackdriver console. Thus you only need to enable a particular Stackdriver feature for your project and cluster, and the tight coupling between Istio and Stackdriver will ensure that the data is sent from your service mesh to the Stackdriver console by default.

Monitoring
If the Stackdriver Monitoring API is enabled in your GCP project, your Istio mesh will automatically send metrics related to your services (such as the number of bytes received by a particular service) to Stackdriver, where they will appear in the Metrics Explorer. You can use these metrics to create custom dashboards and alerts, letting you monitor your services over time and receive alerts when, for example, a service is nearing a specified number of requests.

You can also combine these metrics using filters and aggregations with Stackdriver's built-in metrics to get new insights into your service behaviour. 590

Logging
If the Stackdriver Logging API is enabled in your GCP project, your Istio mesh will automatically send logs to Stackdriver, where they will appear in the logs viewer. See the Stackdriver Logging documentation to find out more about what you can do with the log data, such as exporting logs to BigQuery.

Caution: This feature may incur additional costs for usage, especially with a high volume of logs data. To find out how to disable this feature for your mesh, see Disabling Stackdriver Logging and Tracing.

Tracing
If the Stackdriver Trace API is enabled in your GCP project, your Istio mesh will automatically send trace data to Stackdriver, where they will appear in the trace viewer. Note that to get the most from distributed tracing to help find performance bottlenecks, you will need to change your workloads to instrument tracing headers.

You can find out how to do this in the Istio Distributed Tracing guide. Caution: This feature may incur additional costs for usage, especially with a high volume of trace data. To find out how to disable this feature for your mesh, see Disabling Stackdriver Logging and Tracing.
