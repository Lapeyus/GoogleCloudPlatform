        <pre><h1>Public Cloud Cost Model</h1>
<h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
<p>The public cloud cost model is a pay-as-you-go pricing structure where users only pay for the resources they use.</p>
<h3>Key Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instance Types</strong>: The type of virtual machine or server instance used, which affects compute power and storage.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: The amount of data stored in the cloud, which can be object storage, block storage, or file storage.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transfer</strong>: The amount of data transferred in and out of the cloud, which can incur additional charges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moving to CloudSQL</h2>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relatively straightforward migration from on-premises MySQL</li>
<li>Simple sqldump transfer with minimal downtime</li>
</ul>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Potential for downtime or service disruption during replication</li>
<li>Replication ensures synchronisation between on-premises master and CloudSQL instance</li>
</ul>
<h1>Containers and Kubernetes Engine</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Containers and Kubernetes</h2>
<h3>What are Containers?</h3>
<p>Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies, allowing for efficient deployment and scaling.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Containers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved application portability</li>
<li>Reduced infrastructure overhead</li>
<li>Faster deployment and scaling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hybrid Service: Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine</h2>
<h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
<p>The Kubernetes engine sits between the Compute Engine (IaaS) and App Engine (PaaS), providing a hybrid service that leverages benefits from both.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Hybrid Service</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automation and elasticity from Compute Engine</li>
<li>Self-awareness and dynamic scaling from App Engine</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>Do you fully understand the public cloud cost model? Moving to CloudSQL will be relatively straightforward as it is itself MySQL so it will be a like for like swap. This makes transferring the schema and data straightforward as a simple sqldump that is uploaded into Cloud Storage, which is all that is required. Cloud SQL can then build the schema and data using the sqldump object in the Cloud Storage bucket. There might be an issue with downtime or service disruption but replicating the on-premises master to the CloudSQL MySQL instance will keep the two synchronised without the need for any service disruption.

Chapter 6-Containers and Kubernetes Engine

In this chapter, we will shift the focus away from GCP storage portfolio to containers and the Google Kubernetes engine. We will describe in this chapter why you want to use containers, what their benefits are, and how to manage them in Kubernetes engine.

An introduction to Containers and Kubernetes

In an earlier chapter, we introduced you to the Compute Engine, which is GCP's Infrastructure as a Service offering (laaS), with access to servers, file systems, and networking through the deployment of VMs. We will also discuss the App Engine service, which is GCP's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering in the next chapter. However, for now, it is time to introduce you to containers and Kubernetes engine, which is a hybrid service that conceptually sits between the Compute Engine and App Engine, and as you will see provides benefits from both of the services. The Compute Engine and its functions that deliver automation and elasticity introduce the model of programmable infrastructure. Indeed, using laaS or PaaS such as App Engine makes your applications self-aware and allows them to scale-out and scale-in dynamically.

        <pre><h3>Public Cloud Cost Model and Migration to CloudSQL</h3>
<p>The public cloud cost model is a complex topic, but moving to CloudSQL will be relatively straightforward due to its similarity to MySQL. This allows for a like-for-like swap, making the transfer of schema and data as simple as uploading a sqldump into Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>Cloud SQL can then build the schema and data using the sqldump object in the Cloud Storage bucket. However, there may be an issue with downtime or service disruption during this process.</p>
<h3>Containers and Kubernetes Engine</h3>
<p>This chapter shifts the focus away from GCP storage to containers and the Google Kubernetes engine. It explains why you would want to use containers, their benefits, and how to manage them in Kubernetes engine.</p>
<p>Containers provide a hybrid service that sits between Compute Engine and App Engine, offering benefits from both services. Compute Engine provides programmable infrastructure with automation and elasticity, while App Engine offers Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities.</p>
<p>Using containers and Kubernetes engine allows applications to be self-aware, enabling dynamic scaling-out and scaling-in. This model introduces the concept of programmable infrastructure, which is essential for modern application development.</p></pre>
