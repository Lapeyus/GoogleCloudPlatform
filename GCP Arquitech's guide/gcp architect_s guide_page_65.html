        <pre>Runtimes and Libraries May Be All You Need

But if you code for many applications, the App Engine Standard Environment is not the right choice. Instead, you will need to use the Flexible Environment.

The Standard Environment also has some other caveats that you may need to contemplate. It runs in a sandbox, which is a software and security construct that enforces independence of the hardware, operating system, file system, or physical location of the server it runs on. This also enforces segregation and isolation of the code.

Running your code in a sandbox is not necessarily an issue as one of the reasons why App Engine Standard Environment can scale so effectively and manage your application in a very fine-grained way is because of the sandbox. They are also very secure as the code is isolated from the OS, other applications, and the file system. However, sandboxes can and do impose some constraints such as your application can't write to the local file system.

Therefore, your application will have to use a database service if it needs to store data persistently. As a result, Cloud Datastore is tightly coupled with App Engine standard edition to provide that service. Also, all the requests your application receives will have a 60-second timeout, and because code is segregated by design you can't install arbitrary third-party software in a sandbox.

If these constraints will adversely affect your development then that would be another pointer towards using the Flexible Environment.

A Brief Roadmap of How to Use App Engine Standard Environment

First, you develop your application and run a test version of it locally using the App Engine SDK. Then, you use the SDK commands to deploy it. Each App Engine application runs in a GCP project.

App Engine automatically provisions server instances and scales and load balances them. Your application can make calls to a variety of services using dedicated APIs.

App Engine Flexible Environment

If you find the constraints of the App Engine standard environments' sandbox model is just too restrictive or you need to code in another language not supported in the standard environment, then you may want to consider the Flexible Environment version.

A notable difference is that instead of using a sandbox, App Engine flexible environment lets you run your application inside Docker containers on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machines, VMs. In addition, it lets you specify the container your App Engine runs in and the App Engine manages these Compute Engine virtual machines for you.

Furthermore, the VMs are monitored, health-checked, healed as necessary, and you select the geographical region that you want them to run in. Another feature of the flexible Environment is that App Engine will apply automatically any critical backward-compatible updates to their operating systems. All this works transparently so that you can just focus on your code.

App Engine apps use standard runtimes that can access App Engine services such as data store, memcached, task queues, and so on. The simpler standard environment starts up instances of your application faster, but because of the sandbox, you get less access to the infrastructure in which your application runs.

        <pre><h3>Choosing the Right Environment for Your App Engine Application</h3>
<p>When building an App Engine application, it's essential to select the right environment that meets your specific needs. The App Engine Standard Environment and Flexible Environment have different characteristics that may make one more suitable than the other.</p>
<h4>Constraints of the Standard Environment</h4>
<p>The App Engine Standard Environment has some caveats that you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs in a sandbox, which enforces independence from hardware, operating system, file system, or physical location.</li>
<li>Isolated code, making it secure but also imposing constraints such as:<ul>
<li>Limited access to the local file system, requiring the use of a database service like Cloud Datastore.</li>
<li>60-second timeout for all incoming requests, and no ability to install arbitrary third-party software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Flexible Environment</h4>
<p>If you find the constraints of the Standard Environment too restrictive or need to code in another language not supported by the standard environment, consider using the Flexible Environment. This version allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run your application inside Docker containers on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs).</li>
<li>Specify the container your App Engine runs in and have App Engine manage these VMs for you.</li>
<li>Monitor, health-check, heal as necessary, and select the geographical region for your VMs.</li>
<li>Have critical backward-compatible updates applied automatically to operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Differences</h4>
<p>| Environment | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | Runs in a sandbox, isolated code, limited access to file system, 60-second timeout. |
| Flexible | Runs inside Docker containers on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs), allows for more infrastructure access. |</p>
<h3>Roadmap for Using App Engine Standard Environment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Develop your application locally using the App Engine SDK.</li>
<li>Deploy your application using the SDK commands.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Roadmap for Using App Engine Flexible Environment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Develop your application and run a test version locally using the App Engine SDK.</li>
<li>Use the SDK commands to deploy your application.</li>
<li>Consider using the Flexible Environment if you need more infrastructure access or want to code in another language not supported by the standard environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding the characteristics of both environments, you can make an informed decision about which one is best for your specific needs and requirements.</p></pre>
