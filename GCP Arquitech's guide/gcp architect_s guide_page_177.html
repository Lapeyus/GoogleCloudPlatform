        <pre><h1>Regional Load Balancing</h1>
<h2>Network Load Balancing</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data such as the address, port, and protocol type.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Distributes traffic across a pool of servers.</li>
<li>Uses traffic forwarding rules to determine which server to connect to within the target pool.</li>
<li>Defines health checks for instances in the target pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regional Load Balancing vs Proxy Load Balancers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Network load balancing is regional and non-proxy, meaning it's available across multiple zones and doesn't terminate connections from clients.</li>
<li>It provides a way to load balance UDP traffic on non-standard ports, which are not supported by global SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example Use Case</h4>
<p>You can use network load balancing to replicate a 3-tier application on the cloud. Each instance could be an Apache webserver, a PHP application server, or a MySQL back-end.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ol>
<li>The load balancer receives TCP/IP traffic coming in through the internet at the regional level.</li>
<li>It redirects traffic across multiple zones via forwarding rule protocols based on IP address, port, or protocol.</li>
<li>Before forwarding traffic, the load balancer checks against firewall rules to ensure they don't deny forwarding.</li>
<li>If the traffic is not denied, it's forwarded to the designated target pool and its appropriate VM instance.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fail over mechanism: Set up a fail over target pool that exists elsewhere in another zone for redundancy and business continuity purposes.</li>
<li>Continuous deployment model: Apply the redundant environment to a continuous deployment model.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>Regional Load Balancing

In this chapter so far, we have considered the options for global load balancing, specifically HTTP(S), TCP Proxy, and SSL Proxy. However, there are also regional load balancers that you can deploy, which come in two flavors: network load balancers and internal load balancers.

Network Load Balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data such as address, port, and protocol type, and distribute traffic across a pool of servers. To achieve this, network load balancing uses traffic forwarding rules that are applied to incoming traffic flows to determine which server to connect to within the target pool. Each target pool contains server instances set up for load balancing purposes and defines which type of health check should be performed on these instances.

In contrast to HTTP(S), TCP Proxy, and SSL Proxy load balancers, which have global scope, network load balancing is a regional and non-proxy load balancer. When we say that the network load balancer is regional, it means that it is regionally available across multiple zones. Non-proxy means that the network load balancer is effectively a pass-through load balancer as it does not terminate and then proxy connections from its clients. Therefore, the load balancer plays no part in the return path.

However, it does provide a way to load balance UDP traffic as well as TCP and SSL traffic on non-standard ports, which are not supported by global SSL Proxy and TCP Proxy load balancers.

In practice, the networking load balancer receives TCP/IP traffic coming in through the internet at the regional level and can redirect traffic across multiple zones via forwarding rule protocols. For example, you may choose to forward ingress traffic based upon IP address, port, or protocol to a pre-configured target pool of VM instances.

This approach is useful when you have different applications running on different Compute Engine instances. It could be that you are replicating a 3-tier application on the cloud, with one instance being an Apache webserver, another a web-based PHP application server, and the other a MySQL back-end.

Before traffic is forwarded by the load balancer, it will need to check against firewall rules. Remember that load balancers and firewalls are not physical devices, so this doesn't add latency or change in subnet as they are all part of the SDN. Therefore, checks to see if traffic matches any firewall rule that denies its forwarding are performed almost simultaneously and near instantaneously.

Once the firewall rules have been checked, it is either dropped or forwarded to the designated target pool and its appropriate VM instance. This is a simple use case example, but we could add some added features such as a fail-over mechanism, set up a health check, and then have a fail-over target pool which could exist elsewhere in another zone for redundancy and business continuity purposes.

Of course, we don't have to just use that redundant environment just for fail-over; it could equally apply to a continuous deployment model.
