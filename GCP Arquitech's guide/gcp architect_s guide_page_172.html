        <pre>The health check works by polling instances at specified intervals. Instances that do not respond successfully to a specified number of consecutive probes are marked as unhealthy, and no new connections are sent to these instances. Existing connections are maintained to prevent unnecessary disruption.

However, if an instance later starts responding successfully to a specified number of consecutive probes, it is then marked as healthy, and can resume normal operation and receive new connections.

Auto healing is another useful feature that works closely with Health Checks. It allows for automated server monitoring and restarts. For example, if an HTTP health check detects that a service has failed on an instance, the instance can be automatically recreated where the service failed.

To mitigate the risk of a single point of failure and ensure high availability through redundancy, GCP replicates each health checker. These redundant health checkers also probe instances, so if a health checker fails, there is another one instantly available that can take over. These redundant health checkers are created automatically and are not separately user configurable.

Managed Instance Groups provide another benefit by allowing you to automatically add or remove instances from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load. This capability is called autoscaling.

Autoscaling is extremely useful as it allows your applications to gracefully handle increases in traffic load. It can scale up by adding instances when more resources are required under heavy load and scales down when traffic is lower, reducing costs. The autoscaler performs all this automatically based on your policy and the current measured load.

This means you don't need to go into in-depth capacity planning or over-provisioning of resources as the autoscaling works. In short, it allows you to scale up and down without manually adding more instances when there is higher than expected load, and removes instances when the load is lowered.

The concept of automatic upscaling and downscaling of instances in reaction to fluctuations in traffic load raises some interesting questions. In the case of upscaling, the autoscaler determines that the threshold of the number of connections per VM in the group has been reached, so it spins up another instance to lessen the load across the group.

However, with downscaling, it is a bit more problematic because if the load balancer is doing its job and distributing the number of connections across the group, there is unlikely to be one VM conveniently doing nothing. Therefore, when it comes to downscaling, there needs to be a way to close down one of the instances gracefully without any interruption to users.

This is achieved through a technique called connection draining.

<td>A service is a component of an application that provides a specific functionality. In this context, a service refers to a web service or API that is hosted on instances managed by GCP.

In this context, the threshold refers to the maximum number of connections allowed per virtual machine (VM) in a managed instance group. When this threshold is exceeded, the autoscaler determines that more instances are needed to handle the load and spins up additional instances.</td>
