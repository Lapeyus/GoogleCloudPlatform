<h2>Features Not Available in Cloud Spanner</h2>
<p>As part of the migration process, features not available in Cloud Spanner must be implemented in the application. You may want to look at using Cloud Spanner's client libraries for making read and write queries.</p>
<h3>Using API Translated Calls</h3>
<p>Using API translated calls may be faster as the SQL statement does not have to be translated.</p>
<h2>Transferring Data from Oracle to Cloud Spanner</h2>
<p>To transfer your data from Oracle to Cloud Spanner, you will need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export your Oracle database to a portable file format (e.g., CSV)</li>
<li>Upload the file into a Cloud Storage bucket</li>
<li>Import the file into Cloud Spanner using the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process in Cloud Dataflow</li>
</ol>
<h3>Benefits of Using Cloud Dataflow</h3>
<p>Cloud Dataflow provides a service for running data pipelines in order to read and process large amounts of data in parallel over several servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataflow is based upon Apache Beam</li>
<li>Uses the Beam SDK connectors for Cloud Storage and Cloud Spanner</li>
<li>No coding necessary, only code the actual ETL process</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintaining Consistency Between Databases</h2>
<p>The problem with maintaining consistency between databases during the migration process is that you cannot keep both databases offline for the length of time the data import/export takes.</p>
<h3>Solutions for Maintaining Consistency</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use Oracle Change Data Capture feature</li>
<li>Programmatically implement simultaneous updates in your applications</li>
</ol>
<h2>Switching to Cloud Spanner as Source of Truth</h2>
<p>When you have verified the data, the final step in the migration will be switching to Cloud Spanner as consistency and synchronisation of the data.</p>
<h3>Importance of Keeping the Oracle Database Up-to-Date</h3>
<p>You should continue to keep the Oracle database up-to-date as this provides a rollback path in case there are issues with the migration.</p></pre>

        <pre>Modifying the Application to Use Cloud Spanner

As part of the migration process, features not available in Cloud Spanner must be implemented in the application. You may want to look at using Cloud Spanner's client libraries for making read and write queries. These use Cloud Spanner-specific API calls.

Using API calls may be faster as the SQL statement does not have to be translated. Transferring your data from Oracle to Cloud Spanner requires exporting your Oracle database to a portable file format, such as CSV, then uploading the file into a Cloud Storage bucket. From there, it can be imported into Cloud Spanner using the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process in Cloud Dataflow.

Cloud Dataflow provides a service for running data pipelines in order to read and process large amounts of data in parallel over several servers. Dataflow is based upon Apache Beam and uses the Beam SDK connectors for Cloud Storage and Cloud Spanner, so there is no coding necessary. You will only have to code the actual ETL process.

Maintaining Consistency Between Databases

The problem with maintaining consistency between databases during the migration process is that you cannot keep both databases offline for the length of time the data import/export takes. Unfortunately, when transferring the data, it may be stale as the applications continue to write new data to update the existing on-premises Oracle database.

Nonetheless, you need to keep the databases synchronized and there are several ways to do this, such as by using the Oracle Change Data Capture feature or programmatically implementing simultaneous updates in your applications. Your application's source of truth is crucial when verifying the data.

Switching to Cloud Spanner

The final step in the migration will be switching to Cloud Spanner as consistency and synchronisation of the data. You can then switch your application to point to Cloud Spanner. It is essential to continue keeping the Oracle database up-to-date, as this provides a rollback path should there be issues.

<p>Cloud Dataflow provides a service for running data pipelines in parallel over several servers, utilizing Apache Beam and Beam SDK connectors for Cloud Storage and Cloud Spanner. This eliminates the need for coding; only the actual ETL process needs to be coded.</p>
<h2>Maintaining Consistency During Migration</h2>
<p>The primary challenge during migration is maintaining consistency between both databases. To address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Oracle Change Data Capture feature or programmatically implement simultaneous updates in your applications.</li>
<li>Keep the application's source of truth, verifying data before switching to Cloud Spanner.</li>
<li>Continue to keep the Oracle database up-to-date, providing a rollback path in case issues arise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Step: Switching to Cloud Spanner</h2>
<p>After verifying data consistency and synchronisation, switch your application to point to Cloud Spanner. This marks the final step in the migration process.</p></pre>
