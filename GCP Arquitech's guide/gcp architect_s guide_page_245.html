<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The least secure and least resilient design is where everything is hosted within a single failure domain.</p>
<h3>Definition of Terms</h3>
<p>For cloud architects, sharing is an enabler for collaboration between components of the architecture.
Isolation is a control that prevents the compromise of one part from spreading to the other.</p>
<h3>Decoupling Dependencies</h3>
<p>By decoupling dependencies on one another, we produce more private or fault-tolerant communication channels between them.</p>
<h4>Redesigning with Multiple Failure Domains</h4>
<p>One method is to redesign using multiple failure domains, which inherently provides better isolation and resiliency.</p>
<p>However, distribution of resources leads to increased latency.</p>
<h3>Network Topology Features</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Google Cloud Platform provides many network topology features you can use in your designs to provide different blends of resource sharing and isolation.</p>
<h2>Isolation Techniques</h2>
<h3>Microservice Architecture</h3>
<p>Microservices do not really communicate with other services as they have no concept of downstream or upstream services. Therefore, there is no effective communication with which to compromise another service.</p>
<p>For example, if an exploiter gains access to one machine, they can't get into the others.</p>
<h4>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h4>
<p>Using a VPC means that two different projects under different administrative control but needing to talk to each other will have their own private IP address. This isolates the two networks from each other and may not have authentication space or their own IAM.</p>
<p>So, any user with capabilities to do so can communicate between each party.</p>
<h4>VPN Tunnelling</h4>
<p>This is a more traditional networking technique of IP address-encrypted link between two or more projects. However, if you want projects to talk to each other privately, this is used regularly in on-premises networks.</p>
<p>They can use another private IP address subnet space to increase privacy and even encrypted communications.</p>
<h4>Cross-Project Virtual Private Cloud Network Peering</h4>
<p>This feature allows us to directly connect two projects together using a private IP address. This enables two different companies or organizations to share and collaborate on resources and in projects.</p>
<p>If you need to collaborate with an external partner, you can set identity access controls to control what kind of communication can occur between these two particular domains.</p>

        <pre>Sharing and Isolation

As we demonstrated earlier, the least secure and least resilient design is where everything is hosted within a single failure domain. This is because all components in the design must directly interact, collaborate, and communicate to fulfill the design goals, making them fully dependent on one another.

There are many methods or techniques we can use to separate those inter-related parts by decoupling their dependencies on one another, producing more private or fault-tolerant communication channels between them. One method is to redesign using multiple failure domains, which inherently provides better isolation and resiliency. However, distribution of resources leads to increased latency, so we must also be aware of the need to share and collaborate on resources.

Thankfully, Google Cloud Platform provides many network topology features that can be used in designs to provide different blends of resource sharing and isolation. In the next section, we will take a deeper dive into resource sharing and isolation.

Defining Terms

For cloud architects, sharing is defined as an enabler for collaboration between components of the architecture. On the other hand, architects define isolation as a control that prevents the compromise of one part from spreading to the other. One very effective way to provide isolation is using a microservice architecture.

Microservices do not really communicate with other services as they have no concept of downstream or upstream services; they simply accept an input and hand off an output. Therefore, there is no effective communication with which to compromise another service. For example, should an exploiter gain access to one machine, they can't get into the others.

Natural Separation Techniques

One way to achieve this type of isolation is through leveraging the cloud. For instance, if you have two different projects under different administrative control but need to talk to each other, using a VPC means that they will have their own private IP address space. This allows you to isolate the two networks from each other's communication over the network, without authentication space and their own IAM.

Isolation Using VPN Tunnelling

In this scenario, we can have an encrypted link between two or more projects. While not a feature of Google Cloud Platform, if you want projects to talk to each other privately, it is used regularly in on-premises networks. You can use another private IP address subnet space to increase the privacy and even encrypt communications.

Cross-Project Virtual Private Cloud Network Peering

Then there's a new feature called cross-project Virtual Private Cloud network peering or as it was known, cross-project networking. In this case, network peering allows us to directly connect two projects together using a private IP address. This enables two different companies, two different organizations, to share and collaborate on resources and in projects.

Identity Access Controls

Hence, if you need to collaborate with an external partner and want to be able to communicate, you can set identity access controls. This gives you the ability to control what kind of communication can occur between these two particular domains.

Shared Private Cloud

And then there's the shared private cloud, which provides a secure environment for collaboration and data sharing among multiple organizations.

        <pre><h1><strong>Sharing and Isolation in Cloud Networking</strong></h1>
<p>The least secure design is one where everything is hosted within a single failure domain, as all components must interact and collaborate to fulfill design goals, making them fully dependent on each other. To address this, we can use techniques such as decoupling dependencies, redesigning with multiple failure domains, and leveraging cloud networking features.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining Sharing and Isolation</strong></h2>
<p>In the context of cloud networking, sharing refers to collaboration between components of an architecture, while isolation refers to a control that prevents compromise from spreading to other parts. One effective way to provide isolation is through microservice architecture, where services do not communicate with each other due to their lack of concept of downstream or upstream services.</p>
<h2><strong>Achieving Isolation</strong></h2>
<p>Isolation can be achieved through various methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraging the Cloud</strong>: Using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) provides private IP addresses for networks, isolating them from communication.</li>
<li><strong>VPN Tunnelling</strong>: Encrypting links between projects using VPN tunnelling provides a secure connection.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Project Network Peering</strong>: Directly connecting two projects using a private IP address enables collaboration while maintaining isolation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Shared Private Cloud</strong></h2>
<p>A shared private cloud allows multiple organizations to share resources and collaborate on projects, providing a secure and isolated environment for communication between domains. Identity access controls can be set to control what kind of communication occurs between these domains.</p>
<p>By understanding the importance of sharing and isolation in cloud networking, architects can design more resilient and secure architectures that balance collaboration with security.</p></pre>
