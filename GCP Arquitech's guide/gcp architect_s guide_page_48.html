        <pre><h1>Google Cloud Storage</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is an object file storage system that stores data as arbitrary bytes - blobs - and addresses them with unique keys. This allows for web-friendly interactions and doesn't require provisioning capacity or developing a schema.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<h4><strong>Immutable Objects</strong></h4>
<p>Storage objects within a bucket are immutable, meaning they cannot be edited in place. Instead, new versions are created.</p>
<h4><strong>Encryption</strong></h4>
<p>Data is encrypted on the server side before writing to disk, and encryption is applied by default at rest and when data is in-transit using HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serving website content</li>
<li>Archiving data</li>
<li>Disaster recovery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>No need to provision capacity or develop a schema</li>
<li>High durability and availability</li>
<li>Web-friendly with URL-based access</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Choose a location close to your customer base for minimal latency</li>
<li>Consider legal restrictions on data storage in certain countries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storage Buckets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a globally unique name for the bucket</li>
<li>Specify a geographic location for storage</li>
<li>Choose a default storage class</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data is encrypted on the server side before writing to disk</li>
<li>Encryption is applied by default at rest and when data is in-transit using HTTPS</li>

        <pre>Google Cloud Storage
This is GCP's object file storage which means that instead of storing data in a schema or a file system it stores your data as an arbitrary bunch of bytes - a blob - and the storage system lets you address it with a unique key. Typically these unique keys are in the form of URL's which means object storage interacts nicely with Web technologies.

This is how Google's Cloud Storage works and as it is a form of object storage you don't have to provision capacity or develop a schema before you use it. What this means is that you simply make objects and the service stores them with high durability and high availability and references them via a URL.

Cloud Storage is suitable for many types of data storage requirements such as when serving website content, storing data for archival and even for storing data for disaster recovery. Cloud Storage as we have seen is very web friendly as each of your objects in Cloud Storage has a URL this makes it an ideal method for making available to your end users large data objects via web download.

Google's Cloud Storage is a managed service and it stores your data for you in storage areas called buckets. You will initially create and configure your unique storage bucket then use it to hold your storage objects. The storage objects stored within a bucket are actually immutable, which means that you cannot edit them in place but instead you create new versions.

In addition Cloud Storage always encrypts your data on the server side before it is written to disk and you don't pay extra for that. Furthermore, in a Cloud storage bucket encryption is applied by default at rest and when data is in-transit using HTTPS. This makes it a convenient and secure way to initially move data from your on- premises servers or your computer into GCP.

In this way Cloud Storage acts as an ideal landing post for your data before you move it onwards to other GCP storage services. This is a good way to upload data into GCP as your Cloud Storage objects will be securely stored and organized into buckets. When you create a bucket, you give it a globally unique name and you specify a geographic location where the bucket and its contents are to be stored.

You also choose a default storage class. Therefore, you need to consider a few things before you go ahead and pick a location as ideally you will want a location close to your customer base that will minimizes latency for your application and your end users. In other words, if most of your users are in Europe, you probably want to pick a European location.

There are also legal restrictions about where your customers' data can be stored so for example in the European Union you must store their data within the EU unless you have their explicit permission to store it outside the EU. Therefore, it's best if you operate in Europe or have a large European user base to store your data in a region and zone in Europe.
