Chapter 26 - Building an Architecture for IoT

An Introduction to IoT on Google Cloud Platform

When it comes to demonstrating the power and utility of GCP, a very good use case is when building IoT architecture. The Internet of Things is not just about connecting sensors and manageable devices to the cloud in a scalable fashion, although that in itself is challenging. It is also about ingesting, processing, and analyzing sometimes vast amounts of real-time data. To do this effectively requires a robust IoT cloud architecture.

So, in this chapter, we will describe how to build such an architecture using many of the services we have already learned about that we will use to make up the physical aspects of an IoT network.

In the Industrial Internet of Things as well as in Industry 4.0, interconnectivity between sensors, devices, and systems are fundamental to extracting and ingesting data for further processing and analysis. Data can come in many forms and is being created and captured constantly from machines, systems, and processes.

Some data can be ingested and stored for processing at a later time using batch processing whereas other types need real-time data streaming and processing. An example of data that can be batched processed is quality control data as it can be analyzed at leisure to improve the process. Data that needs instant processing would be machine control data, such as the signals that monitor and control the speed of a motor.
