        <pre><h1>Cloud Migration Considerations</h1>
<h2>Existing Investment</h2>
<p>There is likely to be significant costs associated with servers and support infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Servers</h3>
<p>Servers are likely to be on a hardware lifecycle roadmap, refreshed every 3-5 years. This may be the ideal time to migrate on-premises resources to the cloud.</p>
<h2>Application Performance and Portability</h2>
<p>Consider whether the application can function in the cloud. Compatibility and performance are not likely to be a problem in GCP, but latency and portability must be considered.</p>
<h3>Latency</h3>
<p>Even with unlimited compute and memory resources, limited internet bandwidth may be detrimental to application performance.</p>
<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>Migrating virtualized application servers is not a problem, but external dependencies such as partner data source connections must be considered.</p>
<h2>Network Assessment</h2>
<p>Assess the premises network and how it will integrate with the cloud. Consider deploying cloud-based AD domain controllers and DNS.</p>
<h3>Cloud-Network Integration</h3>
<p>The cloud network must function for both on-premises and cloud access. This requires a secure communications path between the cloud and on-premises network.</p>
<h2>Migration Strategy</h2>
<p>Strive for a lift-and-shift of easy applications and databases early on, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. As experience and confidence grow, migrate more complex applications and databases like Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.</p>
<h3>Homogenous vs. Heterogeneous Migration</h3>
<p>A homogenous migration involves migrating similar applications and databases at once. A heterogeneous migration involves migrating different applications and databases separately.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take your time and look for the best deployment methods on an application-to-application basis.</li>
<li>Don't need to lift and shift everything at once.</li>
<li>Consider the best deployment methods for each application and database.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>When evaluating an application for suitability for the cloud, one must consider the existing investment. There is likely to be significant costs associated with servers and support infrastructure. The migration of a server's functionality to the cloud may leave it defunct and a wasted business investment unless the business can somehow repurpose the servers.

Servers are likely to be on a hardware lifecycle roadmap whereby they are refreshed every 3-5 years, so that may be the ideal time to migrate on-premises resources to the cloud.

2. Consider application performance and portability

In the case of application servers, we must consider whether the application can function in the cloud. Compatibility and application performance are not likely to be a problem in the GCP environment, but you must consider two important aspects: latency or delay and applications portability.

The first aspect is latency or delay because even though you can provision the virtual instance for the application server with nearly unlimited compute and memory resources if there is limited internet bandwidth then that may well be detrimental to the application performance. The second aspect to consider will be the applications portability. In this case, migrate a virtualized application server to the cloud will not be a problem but the application might have some important external dependencies.

3. Assess the network premises and how it will integrate with the cloud

If an organization wants their users to be able to access applications in premises and some in the cloud, the cloud network must function seamlessly or if they wish to keep some of their resources on as an extension of the on-premises network and vice versa. Typically, you have to deploy cloud-based AD domain controllers, DNS, and maintain a secure communications path between the cloud and the on-premises network.

It is essential to understand that when building a migration plan, you do not usually need to move everything at the same time. It's crucial to strive for a lift and shift of easy applications and like-for-like databases early on, which is the low-hanging fruit. Then, as you build experience and confidence, you can start using Compute Engine VMs to migrate virtualization of other legacy applications or databases that aren't directly supported in GCP.

For example, MySQL and PostgreSQL can be considered straightforward since GCP supports these databases natively. This is what would be described as a homogenous migration. However, if you need to later move a Microsoft SQL Server cluster or an Oracle server to the cloud, you could run it within a VM on Compute Engine or a container in Kubernetes.

The point being, you don't need to lift and shift everything at once; take your time, and look for the best deployment methods on an application-to-application basis.

        <pre><h3>Evaluating Application Suitability for Cloud Migration</h3>
<p>When considering cloud migration, it's essential to evaluate existing investments, including server costs and support infrastructure. Servers typically follow a hardware lifecycle roadmap, refreshing every 3-5 years, making this a suitable time for on-premises resources to be migrated to the cloud.</p>
<h3>Application Performance and Portability</h3>
<p>For application servers, consider compatibility and performance in the GCP environment. Two key aspects to evaluate are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Even with unlimited compute and memory resources, limited internet bandwidth can negatively impact application performance.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: Migrating virtualized application servers is not a problem, but external dependencies may require consideration. For example, MySQL databases with partner data source connections that rely on direct connections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessing the Network</h3>
<p>When building a cloud migration plan, consider integrating the premises network with the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure users can access applications in both premises and the cloud.</li>
<li>Deploy cloud-based AD domain controllers and DNS.</li>
<li>Maintain secure communications between the cloud and on-premises networks.</li>
<li>Understand that not all resources need to be migrated at once; prioritize easy applications and databases (low-hanging fruit) first.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Homogenous vs. Heterogeneous Migration</h3>
<p>Migration can be categorized into two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homogenous migration</strong>: Migrating applications with similar requirements, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which are directly supported in GCP.</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneous migration</strong>: Migrating applications with different requirements, such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle servers, which may require running within a VM on Compute Engine or a container in Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take time to evaluate the best deployment methods for each application.</li>
<li>Prioritize easy applications and databases (low-hanging fruit) first.</li>
<li>Build experience and confidence before migrating more complex applications.</li>
