        <pre><h1>Use Case -6</h1>
<h2>A Client's Dilemma</h2>
<p>A client wants to build apps using containers, embracing a continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. However, their current infrastructure isn't flexible enough, and they're unsure how to manage the change.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>There are two parts to this question:</p>
<h3>Part 1: Cloud Development Environment</h3>
<p>Creating a development environment in the cloud would be a highly flexible and agile solution. Developers can spin-up VMs and other resources in seconds without capital outlay or provisioning delays, making development fast and flexible. This also reduces the internal burden on networks and IT, as they no longer need to be involved every time a developer wants to spin up an instance.</p>
<h3>Part 2: Building Apps Using Containers</h3>
<p>When considering building apps using containers, there are a few key factors to take into account:</p>
<h4>Skills and Experience</h4>
<p>The development team needs to have the required skills or experience in creating and managing containers. We can only advise on which platform they could use that supports containers.</p>
<h4>Platform Options</h4>
<p>They have a choice of App Engine Flexible Environment, Compute Engine, or Kubernetes Engine. Each has its place, but if they're serious about containers, Kubernetes is the optimal platform for handling and managing containers at scale.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building apps using containers can be a great way to embrace continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. However, it's essential to consider the development team's skills and experience, as well as choosing the right platform that supports containers.</p></pre>

        <pre>Use Case -6

A client has come to you requesting your advice on whether they should build their apps using containers. They explain they are keen to take advantage of container technology as they want to embrace a continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. The problem is that their current infrastructure isn't very flexible and they are not sure how to manage the change, would a cloud development environment be fit for purpose?

There are actually two parts to this question, first there is the issue of building apps using containers and secondly whether to build a development environment in the cloud. If we address the second point first, we can propose that creating the development environment in the cloud would be a highly flexible and agile solution.

This is because developers can spin-up VMs and other resources in seconds without any capital outlay or provisioning delays. This makes development fast and flexible. Moving the development to the cloud also lessens the internal burden on networks and IT as they no longer will need to be involved every time a developer wants to spin up an instance.

So long as it is managed and audited frequently to ensure there is no proliferation of zombie VMs around it, can be a cost-effective solution. 

Regards the point about containers, we need to take a few things into consideration. One of the points is whether the development team has the required skills or any experience in creating and managing containers.

That of course is not for us to say so we can only advise on which platform they could use that supports containers. Here they have a choice of App Engine Flexible Environment, Compute Engine, or of course the specialist platform Kubernetes Engine.

Each has their place but if they are serious about containers then Kubernetes is the optimal platform for handling and managing containers at scale.

        <pre><p><strong>Building Apps with Containers: A Cloud Development Environment</strong></p>
<p>A client seeks advice on whether to build their apps using containers, aiming to adopt a continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. However, their current infrastructure lacks flexibility, making it uncertain how to manage the change.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the Second Point: Cloud Development Environment</strong></p>
<p>Creating a development environment in the cloud can be a highly flexible and agile solution. Developers can spin-up VMs and other resources in seconds without capital outlay or provisioning delays, making development fast and efficient. This shift also reduces the internal burden on networks and IT, as they no longer need to be involved every time a developer wants to spin up an instance.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations for Containers</strong></p>
<p>When building apps with containers, several factors must be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development Team Skills</strong>: The client's development team should assess their required skills or experience in creating and managing containers. While this is not the advisor's decision, they can recommend platforms that support containers.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Choice</strong>: The client has a choice of platforms to use for container management:<ul>
<li>App Engine Flexible Environment</li>
<li>Compute Engine</li>
<li>Kubernetes Engine (the optimal platform for handling and managing containers at scale)</li>
</ul>
