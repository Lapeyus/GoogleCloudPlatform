        <pre>Chapter 23-Cloud Architecture Layers

The data layer covers the storage and retrieval of data, including mechanisms of storage and retrieval such as databases and file systems, which use access methods like SQL and APIs.

Data layer design includes the data persistent mechanisms, such as database services and storage services, and the data access layer, which encapsulates the persistent mechanisms that expose the data. Characterizing data is crucial; users care about data accessibility and integrity rather than the underlying technology. They want their data to be available when needed, without modification or deletion.

Data storage design methods should aim at persistence, proactive detection, and rapid recovery from the user's perspective. Users can't distinguish between data access, corruption, unavailability, or other engineering terms; they just want their data to be accessible. If a file is denied access due to changed privileges, it feels lost to the user.

To recover accidentally lost data, available methods like versioning should be used. In cases where data is controlled or replicated, live streaming backup mechanisms can be employed. When considering data storage, think about transaction properties and maintaining state requirements. The CAP Theorem makes designers aware of trade-offs required in networked shared data systems.

The CAP Theorem states that a balance must be struck between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. If availability and partition tolerance are prioritized, BASE (Basically Available Storage) can be used, which allows for updates to propagate over time due to data distribution across multiple tables, cubes, and servers. This type of availability enables quick data writing and eventual consistency, making it suitable for Big Data soft state applications.

Data layer design should prioritize user needs, focusing on persistence, detection, and recovery. The CAP Theorem provides a framework for designers to make informed decisions about trade-offs in networked shared data systems.

        <pre><h3>Cloud Architecture Layers: Data Layer</h3>
<p>The <strong>data layer</strong> is responsible for storing and retrieving data, including mechanisms such as databases, file systems, SQL, and APIs.</p>
<h4>Data Layer Design</h4>
<p>The data layer consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Persistent Mechanisms</strong>: Database services and storage services.</li>
<li><strong>Data Access Layer</strong>: Encapsulates persistent mechanisms that exposes the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing the data layer, it's essential to consider how users perceive data. Users care about data integrity, accessibility, and whether the retrieved data is the same as the stored data.</p>
<h4>Characterizing Data</h4>
<p>There are various ways to characterize data (structured/unstructured, persistent/ephemeral), but the primary concern should be based on what the user cares about. The user's perspective focuses on data availability and integrity rather than the underlying technology.</p>
<p>To ensure persistence, proactive detection, and rapid recovery from the users' perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement backup mechanisms such as versioning.</li>
<li>Consider replicated data stores or live streaming backup mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing data storage, consider <strong>data transaction properties</strong> and whether maintaining state is required. The CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) highlights the trade-offs required when creating networked shared data systems.</p>
<h4>CAP Theorem</h4>
<p>The CAP Theorem states that you can't have all three consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously. To achieve a balance between these aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose between consistency and availability or partition tolerance.</li>
<li>Consider using BASE (Basically Available Storage), which provides reassuring availability by allowing updates to propagate over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>BASE's advantages include fast data writing and eventual consistency, making it suitable for Big Data soft state applications.</p></pre>
