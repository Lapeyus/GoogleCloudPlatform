        <pre><h1>Service Accounts in Google Cloud</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Service accounts are a crucial component of Google Cloud Security. They provide a way to authenticate and authorize access to resources across multiple projects.</p>
<h3>Creating a Service Account</h3>
<p>A service account is created with an identity that corresponds to an email address. This email address serves as the username for the service account.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Create a Service Account</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Address</strong>: <code>example-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code>
```</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles and Permissions</h2>
<p>Service accounts can be granted various roles, which determine their level of access to resources. The most common role is the InstanceAdmin Role.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Granting Roles</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>InstanceAdmin Role</strong>: Allows the service account to create, modify, and delete instances.
  <code>bash
  gcloud iam roles add member --member user:serviceAccount@example-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/instanceadmin</code>
```</li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing Service Accounts</h2>
<p>Service accounts can be managed using IAM policies. These policies determine what actions the service account can perform.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Managing Service Accounts with IAM Policies</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editor Role</strong>: Allows the service account to edit resources.
  <code>bash
  gcloud iam policies create editor-policy --policy='{"effects": "ALLOW", "resources": ["*"]}' --member user:serviceAccount@example-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code>
```</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blended Security</h2>
<p>Blended security is achieved by combining resource management, organisational policy, and IAM rules.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Blended Security</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Management</strong>: Configure resource access controls.</li>
<li><strong>Organisational Policy</strong>: Establish organisational policies for resource access.</li>
<li><strong>IAM Rules</strong>: Define fine-grained policies for resource access.
  <code>bash
  gcloud iam policies create blended-security-policy --policy='{"effects": "ALLOW", "resources": ["*"]}' --member user:serviceAccount@example-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code>
```</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Service accounts play a vital role in Google Cloud Security. By understanding how to create, manage, and use service accounts, you can implement effective security measures across your projects.</p>

        <pre>For instance, you may have an application running in a virtual machine, such as a web server, that needs to communicate with another VM, which runs the business logic for the application. This VM in turn needs to store data in Google Cloud Storage, but you have to lock down the access so that only that virtual machine can directly access the data.

In this scenario, you would create a service account to authenticate your VM webserver to the VM application and then only the VM application to the cloud storage. The way that Service accounts work is that they are set up with an identity that corresponds to an email address. That is pretty straightforward but the authentication is less so as a VM cannot enter a password.

Therefore, instead of hard coded passwords, the service accounts use cryptographic keys to access resources. A simple example is if you consider that you have created a service account, which you have granted the InstanceAdmin Role. By having this role the service account could effectively be used to permit an application running in a VM to create, modify, and/or delete other instances.

But the interesting thing about Service accounts are they are more than just identities as they are also resources so they can have their own IAM policies attached to it. This is very handy because service accounts also need to be managed. An example, is maybe Alice needs to manage what can use a given service account, while Bob just needs to be able to view them.

Thus, you can give Alice an editor role in a service account and Bob can have the viewer role. This is just like granting roles for any other GCP resource. However another thing to be aware of is that you can grant different groups of VMs in your project with different identities by creating different service accounts for each distinct group of VMs.

Another convenience is that you can also change the permissions of the service accounts without having to recreate the member VMs. If we consider a more complex example we can see this principle in action. So let us say that we have a very common design whereby we have an application that's implemented across a group of Compute Engine virtual machines.

However the design criteria demands that one component of your application needs to have an editor role on another project, but the other components must not have access. In this case it is possible to manage both design criteria by creating two different service accounts, one for each subgroup of virtual machines.

Only the first service account will be granted privilege on the other project and this reduces the potential impact of a miscoded application or a compromised virtual machine affecting the other project.

Blended Security
In practice security is applied across the GCP through the blending of resource management, organisational policy and IAM rules. It is by combining strategically the policy, rules and privileges at those different tactical levels that we can obtain the fine grained policies that deliver the security principles of separation, maintainability and simplicity.

So let us say that we have a very common design whereby we have an application that's implemented across a group of Compute Engine virtual machines.

However the design criteria demands that one component of your application needs to have an editor role on another project, but the other components must not have access. In this case it is possible to manage both design criteria by creating two different service accounts, one for each subgroup of virtual machines.

Only the first service account will be granted privilege on the other project and this reduces the potential impact of a miscoded application or a compromised virtual machine affecting the other project.

Blended Security
In practice security is applied across the GCP through the blending of resource management, organisational policy and IAM rules. It is by combining strategically the policy, rules and privileges at those different tactical levels that we can obtain the fine grained policies that deliver the security principles of separation, maintainability and simplicity.

Blended Security is a key concept in Google Cloud Security, where you may have an application running in a virtual machine, such as a web server, that needs to communicate with another VM, which runs the business logic for the application. This VM in turn needs to store data in Google Cloud Storage, but you have to lock down the access so that only that virtual machine can directly access the data.

In this scenario, you would create a service account to authenticate your VM webserver to the VM application and then only the VM application to the cloud storage. The way that Service accounts work is that they are set up with an identity that corresponds to an email address. That is pretty straightforward but the authentication is less so as a VM cannot enter a password.

Therefore, instead of hard coded passwords, the service accounts use cryptographic keys to access resources. A simple example is if you consider that you have created a service account, which you have granted the InstanceAdmin Role. By having this role the service account could effectively be used to permit an application running in a VM to create, modify, and/or delete other instances.

But the interesting thing about Service accounts are they are more than just identities as they are also resources so they can have their own IAM policies attached to it. This is very handy because service accounts also need to be managed. An example, is maybe Alice needs to manage what can use a given service account, while Bob just needs to be able to view them.

Thus, you can give Alice an editor role in a service account and Bob can have the viewer role. This is just like granting roles for any other GCP resource. However another thing to be aware of is that you can grant different groups of VMs in your project with different identities by creating different service accounts for each distinct group of VMs.

However the design criteria demands that one component of your application needs to have an editor role on another project, but the other components must not have access. In this case it is possible to manage both design criteria by creating two different service accounts, one for each subgroup of virtual machines.

Only the first service account will be granted privilege on the other project and this reduces the potential impact of a miscoded application or a compromised virtual machine affecting the other project.

Blended Security
In practice security is applied across the GCP through the blending of resource management, organisational policy and IAM rules. It is by combining strategically the policy, rules and privileges at those different tactical levels that we can obtain the fine grained policies that deliver the security principles of separation, maintainability and simplicity.

Blended Security is a key concept in Google Cloud Security, where you may have an application running in a virtual machine, such as a web server, that needs to communicate with another VM, which runs the business logic for the application. This VM in turn needs to store data in Google Cloud Storage, but you have to lock down the access so that only that virtual machine can directly access the data.

In this scenario, you would create a service account to authenticate your VM webserver to the VM application and then only the VM application to the cloud storage. The way that Service accounts work is that they are set up with an identity that corresponds to an email address. That is pretty straightforward but the authentication is less so as a VM cannot enter a password.

Therefore, instead of hard coded passwords, the service accounts use cryptographic keys to access resources. A simple example is if you consider that you have created a service account, which you have granted the InstanceAdmin Role. By having this role the service account could effectively be used to permit an application running in a VM to create, modify, and/or delete other instances.

But the interesting thing about Service accounts are they are more than just identities as they are also resources so they can have their own IAM policies attached to it. This is very handy because service accounts also need to be managed. An example, is maybe Alice needs to manage what can use a given service account, while Bob just needs to be able to view them.

Thus, you can give Alice an editor role in a service account and Bob can have the viewer role. This is just like granting roles for any other GCP resource. However another thing to be aware of is that you can grant different groups of VMs in your project with different identities by creating different service accounts for each distinct group of VMs.

Another convenience is that you can also change the permissions of the service accounts without having to recreate the member VMs. If we consider a more complex example we can see this principle in action.

        <pre><h1><strong>Service Accounts in Google Cloud</strong></h1>
<p>Service accounts are a crucial component of Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. They allow you to authenticate your virtual machines (VMs) to access resources in the cloud.</p>
<h2><strong>Creating Service Accounts</strong></h2>
<p>A service account is set up with an identity that corresponds to an email address. This identity is used for authentication, but since VMs cannot enter passwords, cryptographic keys are used instead.</p>
<h2><strong>Granting Roles and Permissions</strong></h2>
<p>Service accounts can be granted roles and permissions, such as the InstanceAdmin Role, which allows them to create, modify, and delete instances. However, service accounts are more than just identities; they are also resources that can have their own IAM policies attached to them.</p>
<h2><strong>Managing Service Accounts</strong></h2>
<p>Service accounts need to be managed, and this is where roles come in. You can give different roles to different users or groups, such as editor or viewer roles. This allows you to manage access to your service accounts.</p>
<h2><strong>Blended Security</strong></h2>
<p>Security in Google Cloud is applied through the blending of resource management, organisational policy, and IAM rules. By combining these tactical levels, you can obtain fine-grained policies that deliver the security principles of separation, maintainability, and simplicity.</p>
<h2><strong>Example Use Case</strong></h2>
<p>Consider an application implemented across a group of Compute Engine virtual machines. The design criteria demands that one component has an editor role on another project, but other components must not have access. In this case, creating two different service accounts, one for each subgroup of virtual machines, can help manage both design criteria.</p>
<p>By using service accounts and IAM roles, you can reduce the potential impact of a miscoded application or compromised virtual machine affecting other projects. This is just one example of how blended security can be applied in practice.</p></pre>
