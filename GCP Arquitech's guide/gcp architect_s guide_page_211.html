        <pre><h1>Session Affinity and Server Affinity</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Session affinity and server affinity are two important concepts in load balancing and distributed systems.</p>
<h3>Session Affinity</h3>
<p>In session affinity, the load distribution facility acknowledges a client session's existence and tries to direct all requests within that transaction's scope to the same server.</p>
<h3>Server Affinity</h3>
<p>In server affinity, the load distribution facility acknowledges that while multiple servers might be acceptable for a specific client request, a specific server is best suited for processing that particular request.</p>
<h2>Dealing with State</h2>
<p>State information can take many forms and can cause issues if not handled properly. Google's SRI team recommends distributing state information across servers rather than storing it in a central database.</p>
<p>However, this approach has its own set of challenges, such as creating hotspots in the database. To avoid this, it is recommended to push state off of the actual services that are handling and relying on state information, and instead push the state information onto a backend server.</p>
<h2>Measurement</h2>
<p>Measurement is critical in designing a stable and manageable system. This involves setting performance goals and metrics from early prototyping through to commissioning and deployment.</p>
<p>As the Cloud Architect, it is essential to define how your service should look and feel, address customer experience and expectation, and establish metrics that measure reliability and performance.</p>
<h3>Key Performance Indicators</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Customer Experience</li>
</ul>
<h3>Service Level</h3>
<p>The service level refers to the level of reliability and performance expected from a system. It is essential to establish clear service levels to ensure that users feel they are benefiting from your service.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Distribute state information across servers rather than storing it in a central database.</li>
<li>Push state off of actual services and onto a backend server.</li>
<li>Set performance goals and metrics from early prototyping through to commissioning and deployment.</li>
<li>Define how your service should look and feel, address customer experience and expectation.</li>

        <pre>Session Affinity and Server Affinity: Understanding Load Distribution

Session affinity refers to the practice of directing all requests within a client session's scope to the same server. Server affinity, on the other hand, involves acknowledging that multiple servers might be acceptable for a specific client request, but a specific server is best suited for processing that particular request.

In distributed operating systems, the session manager stores information about each client session and considers both session affinity and server affinity while directing client requests to an application server's cluster members. The workload management service takes into account both server affinity and transaction affinity when deciding how to direct client requests between the cluster members of an application server.

Dealing with State

State information can take many forms, from basic key-value pairs contained in a tracking cookie to extensive SQL transactional data in a backend database. Google's SRI team recommends distributing state information across servers rather than storing it in a central database.

However, distributing state across frontend servers also has its issues. One scenario to avoid is creating hotspots in the database. For example, if you distribute state across multiple different servers as per SRI best practices, you store the state with the actual front-end servers handling its associated client. This can lead to a particular server becoming overloaded due to load balancing distributing more stateful transactions to it.

To address this issue, it is recommended to push state off of the actual services that are handling and relying on state information and onto a backend server.

Measurement

In all stages of the design process, from early prototyping through commissioning and deployment, setting performance goals and metrics is crucial for measuring the system's performance. Measurement is considered key to creating a stable and manageable system.

However, evaluating a design does not end with commissioning and sign off. The Cloud Architect will usually still be involved after implementation to hand over knowledge, maintenance tasks, and administration routines to the local support team. This ensures that the system is stabilized and can be operated and maintained properly.

Therefore, it is critical to design from the onset as to how you will identify key performance indicators. These metrics will be used to benchmark system performance. As the architect, it is up to you to define how your service should look and feel, while also addressing customer experience and expectation to establish metrics that let users feel they are benefiting from your service in terms of reliability and performance, which is generally termed the service level.

        <pre><h3>Load Distribution and State Management in Distributed Systems</h3>
<h4>Session Affinity and Server Affinity</h4>
<p>Load distribution facilities can be configured to prioritize either session affinity or server affinity. <strong>Session affinity</strong> directs all requests within a client session's scope to the same server, while <strong>server affinity</strong> acknowledges that multiple servers might be acceptable for a specific client request, but prioritizes a specific server for processing.</p>
<p>In distributed operating systems, the session manager stores information about each client session and considers both session affinity and server affinity when directing client requests to an application server's cluster members. The workload management service takes into account both server affinity and transaction affinity when deciding how to direct client requests between cluster members.</p>
<h4>Dealing with State</h4>
<p>State information can take various forms, from basic key-value pairs in tracking cookies to extensive SQL transactional data in backend databases. Google's SRI team recommends distributing state information across servers rather than storing it in a central database. However, this approach can lead to hotspots in the database if load balancing distributes a large number of stateful transactions to a single server.</p>
<p>To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to push state off of actual services that handle and rely on state information and onto a backend server. This ensures that the state information is not concentrated on a single server, reducing the risk of overload.</p>
<h4>Measurement and Evaluation</h4>
<p>Measuring system performance is crucial in creating a stable and manageable system. Performance goals and metrics should be set throughout the design process from early prototyping to commissioning and deployment. The evaluation of a design does not end with commissioning and sign-off; the Cloud Architect remains involved to hand over knowledge, maintenance tasks, and administration routines to the local support team.</p>
<p>It is essential to define key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to benchmark system performance. As the architect, it is also crucial to address customer experience and expectation by establishing metrics that demonstrate reliability and performance. This is generally referred to as the service level.</p></pre>
