        <pre>Identity-Aware Proxy for Identity Management and VPC for Global Reach using Google's Private Network

The way it works is Cloud Armor at the edge of the network intercepts all incoming connection requests from remote users. Whitelist/blacklist determines IP addresses which are accepted to internal Google hosted applications, using a simple onto the network. The second step is that the connection is established with the global HTTPS load balancer that will forward your request to the application. At this step, the load balancer checks the user's identity using the Identity-Aware Proxy and considers their profile such as groups, roles, and permissions that they are entitled too. It also checks whether the user's job function is compatible with the application or resource that they are requesting access to.

For example, if your job function is an IT Developer, then it will likely reject your request to connect to a Finance system. The Identity-Aware Proxy is not confined to using IAM; it can also check network identity through Active Directory Federations, LDAP, or two-factor methods as these can all be integrated with the Identity-Manager.

Once the identity and authorisation checks have been successfully completed, the user request is passed over the Google private network using private IP addressing to the closest location of the application or resource. On-premises hosts can reach Google APIs and other services over a Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect connection to GCP as they don't need an external IP address; instead, they can communicate using their private IP addresses.

To enable Private Google Access for on-premises hosts, you have to first configure DNS, firewall rules, and routes in your on-premises and VPC networks. You don't need to enable Private Google Access for any subnets in your VPC network as you would for Private Google Access for GCP VM instances.

Cloud Security Scanner

GCP at no additional cost is a web security scanner that detects common vulnerabilities in App Engine, Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine applications. Cloud Security Scanner will automatically scan and detect the most common system vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), Flash injection, mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and insecure libraries.

As a result, Cloud Security Scanner enables you to set up, run, schedule, and manage security scans quickly to identify and remediate well-known vulnerabilities with low false-positive rates.

Use Case - 25

You need to conduct a security audit of the video transcription service to identify any potential vulnerabilities as well as define the protections already in place. You also need to lock down access by applying IAM and Resource Management techniques such as folders and projects to limit access to the infrastructure.

In short, the production and staging internal teams need access as do third-party partners, but external partners should not have access to other internal project teams. How can you achieve these security goals?

Solution

There are many risk mitigation controls provided by GCP by default, so you should identify them before considering any additional security design changes.
