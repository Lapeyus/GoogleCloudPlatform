        <pre><h1>Interconnectivity</h1>
<h2>When You Need It</h2>
<p>GCP also offers a variety of ways for you to interconnect your on-premises or other cloud networks with your Google VPC. 
It's simple to set up a VPN but you will have to manually update the routing add subnets.</p>
<h3>Using Cloud Router</h3>
<p>But if you want to use dynamic routing so that all new subnets will be auto-discovered and propagated then you will need to use, cloud router.
This option makes the update of routing tables dynamic as it will manage the BGP routing updates between your site and the GCP.</p>
<h2>Peering with Google</h2>
<p>You can also peer with Google, through many worldwide points of presence either directly or through a carrier partner. 
Or if you need a service level agreement and can adopt one of their required network topologies, then you are best to use the Dedicated Interconnect.</p>
<h3>Network Billing</h3>
<h4>Ingress and Egress Traffic</h4>
<p>It is important that you understand the usage conditions you will be billed for on GCP's network;
â€¢ First of all, ingress or traffic coming into GCP's network is not billable it's free of charge. 
In addition, all egress traffic within the same zone, to a different GCP service within the same region, or to other Google products like YouTube, Maps, Drive, and Gmail from a VM in GCP with a public or private IP address is not charged either.</p>
<h4>Egress Traffic Charges</h4>
<p>However, there is a charge for egress between zones in the same region and between regions.
These rules apply to charges only for egress traffic through internal IP addresses.</p>
<h4>External IP Addresses</h4>
<p>It is important to realise that there are different billing charges for egress through external IP address, regardless of whether the instances are in the same zone. 
Hence there is no free transfer of egress traffic between VMs in the same zone when using public external IP addresses.</p>
<h2>Designing Your Network</h2>
<p>Another thing to consider when designing your network is your throughput and round-trip latency between virtual machines.
This is going to vary by location, so check your applications requirements against the current specifications for the VPC when choosing where to place the VMs.</p>
<h3>Performance Comparison</h3>
<p>For example, VM to VM communication within a single zone has much more consistent performance than VM to VM communication between regions across continents.</p></pre>

Network Billing
It is essential that you understand the usage conditions you will be billed for on GCP's network. First of all, ingress or traffic coming into GCP's network is not billable; it's free of charge. In addition, all egress traffic within the same zone to a different GCP service within the same region, or to other Google products like YouTube, Maps, Drive, and Gmail from a VM in GCP with a public or private IP address is also not charged.

However, there is a charge for egress between zones in the same region and between regions. These rules apply to charges only for egress traffic through internal IP addresses. It's crucial to realize that there are different billing charges for egress through external IP addresses, regardless of whether the instances are in the same zone. This means that there is no free transfer of egress traffic between VMs in the same zone when using public external IP addresses.

When designing your network, consider your throughput and round-trip latency between virtual machines. This will vary by location, so check your applications' requirements against the current specifications for the VPC when choosing where to place the VMs. For example, VM-to-VM communication within a single zone has much more consistent performance than VM-to-VM communication between regions across continents.

Keep in mind that as VPC is constantly evolving, there are some features marked BETA. These features do not have a service level agreement or SLA and the online documentation states which features are currently in BETA. If you make design changes, you might have to delete networks and subnetworks. Start by deleting your VMs and any related firewall rules, then depending on whether you have an auto-type network or a custom-type network, you might only be able to delete the entire network or the sub-networks independently.

        <pre><h3>Interconnectivity and Network Billing in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h3>
<h4>Interconnectivity Options</h4>
<p>GCP offers various ways to interconnect your on-premises or other cloud networks with your Google VPC. Setting up a VPN is simple, but manual updates of routing tables and adding subnets are required. For dynamic routing, using a Cloud Router is recommended, as it manages BGP routing updates between your site and GCP.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can peer with Google through worldwide points of presence either directly or through a carrier partner. If you need a service level agreement, the Dedicated Interconnect option is the best choice, requiring adoption of one of their required network topologies.</p>
<h4>Network Billing</h4>
<p>To understand the usage conditions for network billing on GCP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingress traffic coming into GCP's network is free.</li>
<li>Egress traffic within the same zone to different GCP services or other Google products with public or private IP addresses is also not charged.</li>
<li>However, there are charges for egress between zones in the same region and between regions, applying only to internal IP addresses.</li>
<li>Using external IP addresses means no free transfer of egress traffic between VMs in the same zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing your network, consider throughput and round-trip latency between virtual machines. This varies by location, so check current VPC specifications against application requirements when choosing VM placement.</p>
<h4>Important Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some features are marked BETA, without a service level agreement or SLA.</li>
<li>Design changes may require deleting networks and subnetworks.</li>
<li>Start by deleting VMs and related firewall rules before deleting networks or subnetworks.</li>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Interconnectivity</h3>
<p>Interconnectivity refers to the process of connecting on-premises or other cloud networks with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VPC. This can be achieved through various methods, including setting up a VPN, using dynamic routing with a cloud router, or peering with GCP through worldwide points of presence.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Network Billing</h3>
<p>Network billing refers to the charges incurred for using GCP's network services. The key aspects of network billing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingress traffic is free of charge.</li>
<li>Egress traffic within the same zone, to a different GCP service within the same region, or to other Google products is not charged.</li>
<li>However, there are charges for egress between zones in the same region and between regions.</li>
<li>External IP addresses incur additional charges regardless of instance location.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topic 3: Network Design Considerations</h3>
<p>When designing a network on GCP, it's essential to consider factors such as throughput and round-trip latency between virtual machines. This can vary by location, so it's crucial to check the current specifications for the VPC when choosing where to place VMs. Additionally, be aware of features marked as BETA, which may not have a service level agreement or SLA.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Network Management and Updates</h3>
<p>When making design changes, it's recommended to delete VMs and related firewall rules first. Depending on the network type (auto or custom), you might only be able to delete the entire network or sub-networks independently.</p></pre>
