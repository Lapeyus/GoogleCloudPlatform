        <pre><h1>Design Methodology</h1>
<h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
<p>An initial step in all project or design methodologies place importance into diligently gathering requirements. This is so that we understand what our design objectives might be.</p>
<h3>Identifying Stakeholders and Asking Questions</h3>
<p>Therefore we can consider that a design always starts by simply identifying the stakeholders and asking them questions.
By asking stakeholders questions you can define the key service level objectives that are important to them and this will  be helpful in thinking through the design decisions later.</p>
<h2>Quantitative Requirements</h2>
<p>Once we have our answers as qualitative requirements it is now time to define them quantitatively, with relation to time, data, and users.
In effect we will be defining how much time we will allow this system to be down. But this is quantitative so there must be logic backing up our decision.</p>
<h3>Cost of Data</h3>
<p>So we have to consider things such as:
- what is the cost of data?
What this means is that how you handle data will come with related costs. For example, data replication for redundancy and data backups for business continuity and DR do not come cheap.</p>
<h2>User Location and Latency</h2>
<p>Another important design requirement will be where are the users located? Are they going to be close to the data? Or are they going to be all over the world?
If it's the latter you will now have to starting to thinking about distributed caching, or about data replication across regions.
The user's locations will define data storage requirements, and it also  defines the time element. The inherent delay in accessing  data storage  around the  world will determine where you  replicate your data  storage.</p>
<h2>Capacity Planning and Scaling</h2>
<p>So there is a lot to think about with storage alone let alone start contemplating capacity planning and; what happens if we had an unexpected growth?
Then we would need some method of automatic scaling. In this case we will  have to start worrying about what resource constraints You will also  need to think about handling state, and where you are going to be important to the design stability?</p>
<h2>Business Logic</h2>
<p>Business Logic is the code that implements business rules, which in turn determines how the data is processed.

        <pre>An initial step in all project or design methodologies places importance into diligently gathering requirements. This is so that we understand what our design objectives might be. Therefore, we can consider that a design always starts by simply identifying the stakeholders and asking them questions.

By asking stakeholders questions, you can define the key service level objectives that are important to them and this will be helpful in thinking through the design decisions later. For example, you might start out asking some basic questions that will provide you with some qualitative requirements; why is the system needed? Or, what problem does it solve? Or, what are the priorities?

Once we have our answers as qualitative requirements, it is now time to define them quantitatively, with relation to time, data, and users. In effect, we will be defining how much time we will allow this system to be down. But this is quantitative so there must be logic backing up our decision.

So, we have to consider things such as what is the cost of data? What this means is that how you handle data will come with related costs. For example, data replication for redundancy and data backups for business continuity and DR do not come cheap. You will also have to contemplate how fast will the data grow? This might mean that you will need a dedicated 10 Gb Ethernet link.

Another important design requirement will be where are the users located? Are they going to be close to the data? Or are they going to be all over the world? If it's the latter, you will now have to start thinking about distributed caching, or about data replication across regions. The user's locations will define data storage requirements and also defines the time element.

The inherent delay in accessing data storage around the world will determine where you replicate your data storage. Of course, this duplication of resources has a financial impact on the design. So, you need to determine what level of latency is acceptable for the production design and any fail-over scenarios.

So, there is a lot to think about with storage alone, let alone start contemplating capacity planning and what happens if we had an unexpected growth? Then, we would need some method of automatic scaling. In this case, we will have to start worrying about what resource constraints you will also need to think about handling state, and where you are going to be important to the design stability?

We need the resources to scale. So, what we have to try and understand is how do we create sufficient dimensions around this forecasted requirement without massive over-provisioning of resources? We also need to consider horizontal or vertical scaling and can our design handle these methods.

A good example is with MySQL as it doesn't scale horizontally; it needs to scale vertically. In this scenario, where you want incremental horizontal scaling, then a NoSQL, data storage solution would be preferable.

Business Logic
In computer science, business logic is the code that implements business rules, which in turn determines how the data is processed.

        <pre><h3>Gathering Requirements: A Foundation for Design Success</h3>
<p>Identifying stakeholders and asking questions is the initial step in all project or design methodologies. This process helps understand design objectives by defining key service level objectives important to stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Basic questions can provide qualitative requirements, such as:
- Why is the system needed?
- What problem does it solve?
- What are the priorities?</p>
<p>These answers help define the scope of the design and guide future decisions.</p>
<h3>Quantifying Requirements</h3>
<p>Once qualitative requirements are established, they must be defined quantitatively. This involves considering factors like time, data, and users.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The user's locations will determine data storage requirements and the time element. The inherent delay in accessing data storage around the world will determine where to replicate data storage. Duplication of resources has a financial impact on the design, so determining an acceptable level of latency is crucial for production designs and fail-over scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Planning and Scaling</strong></p>
<p>There are several factors to consider when planning capacity:
- How do we create sufficient dimensions around forecasted requirements without massive over-provisioning?
- Can our design handle horizontal or vertical scaling?</p>
<p>A good example is using a NoSQL data storage solution for incremental horizontal scaling, as seen with MySQL.</p>
