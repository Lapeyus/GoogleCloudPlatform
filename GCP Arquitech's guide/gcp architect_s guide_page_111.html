        <pre><h1>Compute Engine Roles</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Compute Engine roles provide access to various features and functionalities within the platform.</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>roles/compute.networkUser</strong>: Provides access to a shared VPC network once granted, service owners can use VPC networks and subnets that belong to the host project.</li>
<li><strong>roles/compute.orgSecurityPolicyAdmin</strong>: Full control of Compute Engine Organization Security Policies.</li>
<li><strong>roles/compute.storageAdmin</strong>: Permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Combining Roles</h3>
<p>Roles can be combined to give users or groups specific permissions. For example, granting roles/compute.networkAdmin and roles/compute.securityAdmin allows a networking team to manage networks and apply firewall rules.</p>
<h1>VM Lifecycle</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Understanding the lifecycle of a VM is crucial for knowing its status at any given time, especially for billing purposes.</p>
<h3>Stages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provisioning State</strong>: The initial stage after configuring VM properties. Resources are reserved but the VM itself isn't running.</li>
<li><strong>Staging State</strong>: The next stage where resources are moved from being reserved to acquired and the instance is prepared for launch.</li>
<li><strong>Running State</strong>: Where the VM starts doing useful work, executing pre-configured startup scripts, and enabling SSH or RDP access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>The running state offers flexibility with tasks such as:
- Moving VMs to different zones
- Taking snapshots of persistent disks for backup or migration purposes
- Exporting system images
- Re-configuring metadata</p>
<p>However, some admin tasks require stopping the virtual machine.</p></pre>

Roles in Compute Engine
These are just some of the predefined roles within Compute Engine that serve specific job functions and roles. However, you can combine several roles and give them to a user or group. For example, if your networking team is responsible for managing the network and applying firewall rules, you can grant roles/compute.networkAdmin and roles/compute.securityAdmin to allow the networking team to do only those specific tasks.

VM Lifecycle
It is essential to understand the lifecycle of a VM so that you know the exact status of the VM at any given time - for billing purposes. The lifecycle of a VM is represented by different stages and their related status.

The initial stage is the provisioning state, which occurs after configuring all properties of a VM such as CPU, memory, disk, OS, and clicking create. Once the VM goes through the internal build process, it enters the provisioning state. At this point, all the VM's resources such as CPU, memory, and disks are being reserved, but the VM itself isn't running at this stage.

The next stage is when the newly provisioned VM moves to the staging state. This is where the resources have been moved from being reserved to acquired, and the instance is prepared for launch. It is in this staging state that the Compute Engine is configuring the resources and adding IP addresses as well as starting the booting up process for the OS image.

Once the staging stage completes and the system has booted, the VM is now in the running state. This is the state where it will start doing useful work such as executing pre-configured startup scripts and enabling SSH or RDP access. The running state is where the VM is fully operational and can do all the tasks that any physical server could manage.

However, a VM can do a lot of things that you can't achieve on a physical server. For example, you can live-migrate your virtual machine from one host to another host in the same zone instead of requiring an instance to be rebooted.

This feature is not only beneficial to you as it also allows Google to perform maintenance tasks critical to keeping the infrastructure running. Indeed, the live migration feature may work transparently to you as Google works behind the scenes to keep the infrastructure protected and reliable without any interruption to your service on any of your VMs.

The great thing from an administration perspective is that there are many tasks you can complete while the VM is running. These include the ability to move your VM to a different zone, take a snapshot of the VM's persistent disk for backup or for VM migration purposes, exporting the system image, or re-configuring metadata. However, not all admin tasks can be performed on the fly as some actions require you to stop your virtual machine. Some of the tasks that will require you to enter the stopped state are if you want to upgrade your machine by adding more CPUs.

        <pre><h3>Compute Engine Roles and VM Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Compute Engine provides several predefined roles that serve specific job functions, such as managing networks, security policies, and storage. These roles can be combined to grant users or groups access to specific tasks.</p>
<h4>Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>roles/compute.networkUser</code>: Provides access to a shared VPC network once granted.</li>
<li><code>roles/compute.orgSecurityPolicyAdmin</code>: Full control of Compute Engine Organization Security Policies.</li>
<li><code>roles/compute.storageAdmin</code>: Permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles can be combined to grant users or groups specific permissions. For example, a networking team can be granted <code>roles/compute.networkAdmin</code> and <code>roles/compute.securityAdmin</code> to manage networks and apply firewall rules.</p>
<h3>VM Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Understanding the lifecycle of a VM is crucial for billing purposes and administration tasks. The lifecycle consists of several stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Provisioning State</strong>: After configuring all properties, such as CPU, memory, disk, OS, and clicking create.</li>
<li><strong>Staging State</strong>: Resources are reserved, but the VM itself isn't running. This stage includes configuration and booting up process for the OS image.</li>
<li><strong>Running State</strong>: The VM is fully operational, executing pre-configured startup scripts, and enabling SSH or RDP access.</li>
</ol>
<p>The running state allows for live migration of virtual machines from one host to another in the same zone without requiring a reboot. This feature is beneficial for administration tasks, such as moving VMs to different zones, taking snapshots, exporting system images, or re-configuring metadata.</p>
<p>However, not all admin tasks can be performed on the fly, and some actions require stopping the virtual machine. Upgrading machines by adding more CPUs requires entering the stopped state.</p></pre>
