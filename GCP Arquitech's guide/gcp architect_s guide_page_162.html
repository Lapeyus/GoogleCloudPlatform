        <pre><h1>Cloud Interconnect and VPN Options for GCP</h1>
<h2>Overview of Cloud Interconnect and VPN Options</h2>
<p>Cloud Interconnect is a dedicated connection between your on-premises network and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides high-speed, low-latency connectivity without the need for public internet.</p>
<h3>Types of Cloud Interconnect Attachments</h3>
<h4>Dedicated Interconnect (Private ASN)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use a private Autonomous System Number (ASN) for secure connections</li>
<li>Suitable for sensitive data or applications requiring high security</li>
</ul>
<h4>Partner Interconnect (Public ASN)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use a public ASN for connections over the internet</li>
<li>Required for Google's Partner Interconnect option</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cloud Router and VPN Options</h3>
<p>Cloud Router supports multiple interfaces, eliminating the need for separate Cloud Routers for each VPN tunnel or interconnect attachment.</p>
<h4>Classic VPN and HA VPNs with Dynamic Routing via Cloud Router</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enables reliable and secure connections over the internet from your location to GCP</li>
<li>May be restrictive for high data transfer or low latency requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Google Cloud Interconnect Communication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provides direct physical connections and RFC1918 case</li>
<li>Suitable for applications requiring high-speed, low-latency connectivity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of Cloud Interconnect</h3>
<ul>
<li>More cost-effective than purchasing additional internet bandwidth with VPN tunnels</li>
<li>Faster and more predictable latency compared to public internet</li>
<li>Traffic flows over a dedicated connection with fewer hops, reducing points of failure</li>
</ul>
<h4>Direct Access to VPC Network IP Addresses</h4>
<ul>
<li>No need for VPN tunnels or network routing protocols to reach internal IP addresses</li>
<li>VPC network's internal IP addresses are directly accessible from on-premises networks</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>An interconnect attachment (VLAN) for a Dedicated Interconnect (you use a private ASN)
An interconnect attachment (VLAN) for a Partner Interconnect over the internet (You must use a public ASN)

However, Cloud Router does support multiple interfaces so you will not need to create a separate Cloud Router for each VPN tunnel or interconnect attachment (VLAN). However, each Cloud Router uses the same Autonomous System Number (ASN) for all of its BGP sessions. Because, the Google option of Partner Interconnect does require that you have your own public ASN and that all the other types of interface require private ASNs. This means that a Cloud Router that manages the BGP sessions for an interconnect attachment (VLAN) on a Partner Interconnect cannot manage BGP sessions for any other type of interface.

When you create a Cloud Router service so that you can dynamically exchange routes between your cloud VPC network and your on-premises network, you effectively establish BGP sessions between it and your on-premises router. By default, Cloud Router will advertise only the subnets within its own region for regional dynamic routing or for all subnets in a VPC network for global dynamic routing.

You can also create your own custom route advertisement; this is where you tell BGP specifically which routes that you want Cloud Router to advertise, such as external static IP addresses or specific CIDR ranges.

Classic VPN and HA VPNs supporting dynamic routing via the Cloud Router enables you to connect reliably and securely over the internet from your location to the GCP. However, if you are transferring lots of data or require high data speeds with low latency, then a VPN might be too restrictive for your needs. In that service, which provides direct physical connections and RFC1918 case, you may want to consider the Google Cloud Interconnect communication between your on-premises network and Google's network.

Cloud Interconnect
Cloud Interconnect will enable you to transfer large amounts of data quickly and securely between directly connected networks. This method of interconnection can be more cost-effective than purchasing additional large amounts of internet bandwidth when using VPN tunnels. It will also be much faster and latency more predictable as you are no longer subject to the vagaries of the Internet.

This is because the traffic flowing between your on-premises network and your VPC network doesn't traverse the public internet. Instead, the traffic flows over a dedicated connection with fewer hops, meaning there are less points of failure where network traffic might get delayed, dropped or lost.

Furthermore, you do not need to use a VPN tunnel as your VPC network's internal IP addresses are directly accessible from your on-premises network. This is because they are now directly connected as an extension of your on-premises local area network. Therefore, you don't need to use a network routing protocol to reach the VPC's internal IP addresses.

        <pre><p><strong>Cloud Interconnect and VPN Options for Reliable Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>When connecting your on-premises network to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you have several options to establish reliable connectivity. Two primary methods are Cloud Router, Classic VPN, and HA VPN, as well as Cloud Interconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Router</strong></p>
<p>A Cloud Router is a service that enables dynamic routing between your cloud VPC network and on-premises network. It establishes BGP sessions with your on-premises router, allowing for reliable and secure connectivity over the internet. However, this method may not be suitable for high-bandwidth or low-latency applications.</p>
<p><strong>Classic VPN and HA VPN</strong></p>
<p>These services provide direct physical connections and RFC1918 addressing, making them more suitable for high-bandwidth and low-latency requirements. However, they can be restrictive in terms of data transfer rates and latency.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Interconnect</strong></p>
<p>Cloud Interconnect is a dedicated connection method that enables fast and secure data transfer between directly connected networks. This approach is more cost-effective than purchasing additional internet bandwidth when using VPN tunnels. The key benefits of Cloud Interconnect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster data transfer rates</li>
<li>Lower latency</li>
<li>Reduced points of failure</li>
<li>Direct access to VPC network's internal IP addresses without the need for a VPN tunnel</li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing Cloud Interconnect, you can establish a dedicated connection between your on-premises network and GCP, providing a more reliable and efficient connectivity solution.</p></pre>
