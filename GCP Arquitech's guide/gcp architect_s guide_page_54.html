<p>The modern approach is to use NoSQL databases, which are built to allow the insertion of data without any predefined schema.

        <pre>Cloud Bigtable
Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL, Big Data database service. What the term NoSQL with regards database technology means is that it is 'Not Only SQL' and the difference between NoSQL and the traditional SQL relational database is that the former is better suited to today's application data loads and development lifecycles.

Relational databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data. A schema is a collection of relational tables that consist of records and fields. For example, you might want to store data in a customer record that hold data in fields, such as phone numbers, first and last name, address, city and postcode. Hence, an SQL database needs tables, records and fields in a DB schema to be preconfigured in advance in order to store the data into the relevant customer record.

However, this pre-configuration and planning of the database schema fits poorly with modern agile development approaches, because each time you complete new features, the schema of your database often needs to change. If the database is large or reiterations frequent, this can involve significant downtime. Also it is unlikely that, using a relational database, you would be able to effectively accommodate data that's completely unstructured or unable to fit a pre-defined schema.

The modern approach is to use NoSQL databases, which are built to allow the insertion of data without any predefined schema. That makes it easy to make significant application changes in real-time, without worrying about service interruptions - which means development is faster, code integration is more reliable, and less database administrator time is needed.

Despite this SQL and relational databases do excel in certain areas such as in transactional processes  as an enforced schema is a big help for some applications  but it is also a big hindrance for  others. This is simply because many  modern  apps  require a much more flexible approach, hence the move  towards the NoSQL schema . These applications do not need all the rows to have the same columns. And in fact, the database might be designed to take advantage of that by sparsely populating the rows.

That's part of what makes your NoSQL database in Bigtable what it is as its tables are sparsely populated so that they can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns allowing you to store petabytes of data. Fortunately Google GCP offers Cloud Bigtable as a fully managed service so much of the technology complexity and data schema is transparent to you, so you don't have to worry about configuring and tuning it.

Therefore you can just look upon it as being an ideal place for storing large amounts of data with very low latency. As such it is also perfect for storing data that has a single lookup key and it also supports high throughput, both read and write, so it's a great choice for both operational and analytical applications including Internet of Things, user analytics and financial data analysis.

Cloud Bigtable is offered through the same open source API as HBase, which is the native database for the Apache Hadoop project. Having the same API enables the portability of applications between HBase and Bigtable. However Cloud Bigtable has a few advantages most notably with regards scalability. For if you have worked with and managed your own Hbase installation, you will know that once you hit a certain rate of queries per second scaling gets difficult.

But scaling with Cloud Bigtable is easy as you can just increase your machine count which doesn't even require downtime.
