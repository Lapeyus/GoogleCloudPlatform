        <pre><h1>Service Level</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to define a service level, you must first identify what your customer expects from the service and what features and functions that they care about.</p>
<h2>Service Level Indicators (SLIs)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Service Level Indicators or SLIs are directly observable and measurable by users. They should be quantitative measures of an attribute of the service.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Error-rate</li>
<li>Latency</li>
<li>Availability</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Measuring internal system metrics such as CPU utilization or network bandwidth utilization is not effective for determining user experience. Instead, SLIs should be used to measure attributes that affect user experience, such as excessive delay, application hanging, or failure to complete a process.</p>
<h2>Service Level Objective (SLO)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The Service Level Objective or SLO is a target of system performance and a set threshold to measure against. It allows designers to use SLIs to meet customer expectations by addressing and controlling service level indicators.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typically used within in-house operations and applications.</li>
<li>May be required for formal business contracts with cloud services providers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A Service Level Agreement or SLA is a formal agreement between a provider and consumer that guarantees a certain level of service performance. It outlines the expected levels of service quality, including availability, response times, and error rates.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee 99.99% uptime.</li>
<li>Specify performance thresholds for latency, error-rate, and other attributes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>SLAs provide a clear understanding of what is expected from a service provider and help manage customer expectations. They are particularly important for critical cloud services that require high levels of reliability and performance.</p></pre>

        <pre>Service Level

In order to define a service level, you must first identify what your customer expects from the service and what features and functions that they care about. Hence the first step in designing a good customer experience is to identify the Service Level Indicators or SLIs that deliver the best customer solution. This of course should mean benchmarking each process and following through a function from start to finish. This can mean measuring the time to execute for every process and how many CPU threads it might consume.

These benchmarks will give us performance metrics and the thresholds for each of these SLIS. What this means is that the users will have a real-world benchmark to decide whether the service is working properly. Having this fixed indicator or target of system performance and a set threshold to measure against allows us to determine the Service Level Objective or SLO.

The designer can use the SLO to finesse their architecture and meet customer expectations by addressing and controlling the service level indicators. Typically though, the SLO is only used within in-house operations and applications. The SLO provides a major metric for application design as it sets the level for application performance and customer experience when internal to the organisation.

Nonetheless, some cloud services will be so critical to an organisation that a formal business contract will be needed. When you have a requirement for a formal legal agreement to exist between the provider and the consumers to guarantee a service level and perhaps even to compensate the consumers if the service fails to meet this expectation, then things become more complex.

This is where we have Service Level Agreement or SLA and when define how a given service or product should behave and be fit for they come into the picture. Service levels agreements (SLA) will purpose under normal production environments. There are a number of factors that might be contemplated within service levels agreements, which will be dependent on the critically of the service.

For example, the SLI's might be determined on availability. In this scenario, the SLA specifications night guarantee 99.99 percent up time or perhaps other performance specification such as a Regardless, service levels, whether they are SLO or SLA, will determine the user's expectation and they manage customer minimum latency expectations.

Service Level Indicators

When we select service level indicators, we should ensure that they are directly observable and measurable by the users. This means that the SLIs should not be internal system metrics such as CPU utilization or other internal metrics such as network bandwidth utilization.

The reason for this is that the user must be able to relate to the indicator and be able to directly measure them and that is not something they can do with those internal system metrics. Another reason is that measuring utilization isn't actually an effective measure of the usability of a system. Rather, utilization is best deployed as a metric by auto-scalars to maintain a consistent user experience.

Service Level Indicators should be a quantitative measure of an attribute of the service. SLIs could represent things such as error-rate, latency, or availability. Finally, the user experience will be determined by application performance, which will be determined to be poor more commonly when there is excessive delay, the application hanging or the failure to complete a process.

Therefore, we should make sure you are measuring the correct pain points when setting your SLIs.

        <pre><h3>Defining Service Level and Identifying Key Indicators</h3>
<p>To define a service level, it's essential to identify what customers expect from the service and what features and functions they care about. The first step in designing a good customer experience is to identify Service Level Indicators (SLIs) that deliver the best customer solution.</p>
<h3>Benchmarking and Performance Metrics</h3>
<p>Benchmarking each process and following through a function from start to finish can help measure performance metrics and thresholds for SLIs. This provides users with a real-world benchmark to decide whether the service is working properly. The designer can use these benchmarks to determine the Service Level Objective (SLO) and address customer expectations.</p>
<h3>Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</h3>
<p>When critical cloud services are involved, a formal business contract may be necessary to guarantee a service level and compensate consumers if the service fails to meet expectations. This is where Service Level Agreements (SLAs) come into play. SLAs define how a given service or product should behave and be fit for purpose.</p>
<h3>Key Considerations for SLIs</h3>
<p>When selecting service level indicators, it's crucial to ensure they are directly observable and measurable by users. Internal system metrics such as CPU utilization or network bandwidth utilization should not be used, as they do not provide an effective measure of the usability of a system. Instead, SLIs should represent quantitative measures of attributes such as error-rate, latency, or availability.</p>
<h3>Determining User Expectations</h3>
<p>The user experience will be determined by application performance, which is often poor when there is excessive delay, the application hangs, or the failure to complete a process. Therefore, it's essential to measure the correct pain points when setting SLIs to ensure that customer expectations are met.</p></pre>
