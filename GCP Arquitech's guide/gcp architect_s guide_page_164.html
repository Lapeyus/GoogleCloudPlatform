        <pre><h1>High-Performance Applications</h1>
<h2>Benefits of Direct Connection</h2>
<p>In another use case, we can see the benefits of a direct connection in the hosting of high-performance, latency-sensitive applications. For example, you might have VPC webservers that benefit from GCP load balancers, but they may still be pulling data from on-premise database servers.</p>
<h2>Peering with Google</h2>
<p>This could be because the data is highly sensitive and you are not permitted to store it in the cloud. However, by peering with Google across a direct connection will ensure that you have the lowest latency possible between the two locations.</p>
<h2>Cloud Interconnect</h2>
<p>Finally, Cloud Interconnect allows you to take full advantage of your own, your partners, or Google's Content Delivery Network (CDN).</p>
<h3>Direct Peering</h3>
<p>Direct peering is a private connection between your network and Google's network, where you will exchange BGP autonomous system numbers. An autonomous system number is your registered identity on the internet that represents your block of public IP addresses.</p>
<h4>How it Works</h4>
<p>Your co-located router and Google's edge router will form a BGP session as peers. With this established connection, you can exchange routing updates and pass internet traffic between your network and Google.</p>
<h3>Direct Connection through a Partner</h3>
<p>In some locations it might not be technically feasible to meet at a Google edge point-of-presence. In that case you can go through one of Google's partner's locations.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Carrier peering allows you to obtain the same benefits of enterprise-grade network services that connect your infrastructure to Google. You can also make connections with higher availability and lower latency using one or more links.</p>
<h3>Shared &amp; Network VPC</h3>
<p>In large organizations, you may need to put different departments or different applications into different projects for purposes of separating budgeting, access control, or for privacy.</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>However, with GCP you can share a VPC networks across projects in your cloud organization using shared VPC. With shared VPC, cloud organization administrators can give multiple projects permission to use a single shared VPC network and corresponding networking resources.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, direct connection is an essential feature for high-performance applications. By peering with Google across a direct connection, you can ensure the lowest latency possible between the two locations. Additionally, Cloud Interconnect allows you to take full advantage of your own, your partners, or Google's Content Delivery Network (CDN).</p></pre>

        <pre>In another use case, we can see the benefits of a direct connection in the hosting of high-performance, latency-sensitive applications. For example, you might have VPC webservers that benefit from GCP load balancers, but they may still be pulling data from on-premise database servers. This could be because the data is highly sensitive and you are not permitted to store it in the cloud. However, by peering with Google across a direct connection will ensure that you have the lowest latency possible between the two locations.

Finally, Cloud Interconnect allows you to take full advantage of your own, your partners, or Google's Content Delivery Network (CDN). Knowing some basics about why you may want to use GCP services to achieve external peering let's look into how it can be done in practice.

Direct peering is a private connection between your network and Google's network, where you will exchange BGP autonomous system numbers. An autonomous system number is your registered identity on the internet that represents your block of public IP addresses. Your co-located router and Google's edge router will form a BGP session as peers. With this established connection, you can exchange routing updates and pass internet traffic between your network and Google.

After a direct peering connection is in place, you can use it to reach all of Google's services including the full suite of Google Cloud platform products.

In some locations, it might not be technically feasible to meet at a Google edge point-of-presence. In that case, you can go through one of Google's partner's locations. It's a similar setup, but you have a service provider, a so-called middleman hosting the co-location on your and Google's behalf.

Carrier peering allows you to obtain the same benefits of enterprise-grade network services that connect your infrastructure to Google. You can also make connections with higher availability and lower latency using one or more links.

In large organizations, you may need to put different departments or different applications into different projects for purposes of separating budgeting, access control, or for privacy. However, it is often not the desire to strictly isolate these departments; it is only to control access and manage resources. Sometimes, it is likely that you will want to share some information or services with other departments.

Indeed, sharing resources would actually be highly beneficial to the organization as it prevents them from being duplicated unnecessarily in every project. Also, it would reduce resource spread and reduce costs if projects could share common resources. However, with GCP, you can share a VPC network across projects in your cloud organization using shared VPC.

With shared VPC, cloud organization administrators can give multiple projects permission to use a single shared VPC network and corresponding networking resources.

        <pre><h3>Direct Connection for High-Performance Applications and Shared VPCs</h3>
<p>Direct connection is beneficial in hosting high-performance, latency-sensitive applications. For instance, VPC webservers may benefit from GCP load balancers but still pull data from on-premise database servers due to sensitive data constraints.</p>
<p>By peering with Google across a direct connection, you can ensure the lowest latency possible between locations. Cloud Interconnect allows you to utilize your own, partners', or Google's Content Delivery Network (CDN).</p>
<h3>Direct Peering</h3>
<p>Direct peering is a private connection between your network and Google's network, exchanging BGP autonomous system numbers. This establishes a BGP session as peers, allowing for routing updates and internet traffic exchange.</p>

<h3>Shared &amp; Network VPC</h3>
<p>In large organizations, separating departments into different projects for budgeting, access control, or privacy may not be desired. Instead, controlling access and managing resources is often the goal. Sharing resources can benefit the organization by preventing duplication, reducing resource spread, and lowering costs.</p>
<p>GCP's shared VPC allows cloud organization administrators to share a VPC network across projects, giving multiple projects permission to use a single shared VPC network and corresponding networking resources.</p></pre>
