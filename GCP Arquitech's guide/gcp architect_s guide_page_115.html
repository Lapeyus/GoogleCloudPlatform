        <pre>For example, consider this scenario where you have two instances that have different custom configurations and run at different times of the month. In this scenario Compute Engine breaks down the number of virtual CPUs and amount of memory used across all the custom instances and then aggregates the resource usage to qualify for the biggest sustained usage discounts possible. More specifically, Compute Engine will aggregate all of the CPU and memory resources, multiplied by the amount of time that they were used, and then apply the appropriate sustained used discounts.

Finally one last thing about machine types and that is you should be aware of the advantages of the pre-emptible VM. This is a VM instance that you can create and run at a much lower price - typically circa 80% discount - than normal VMs. Therefore, you really should investigate whether your application can function completely on pre-emptible VMs or at least benefit from an 80 percent discount, which is a significant saving.

To make this point clear, these VMs have their drawbacks after all; you don't get a huge discount for nothing, so a VM might be preempted or terminated at any time. This is something you should be aware of, but it is still a cost-effective way to use a VM as there's no charge if that happens within the first 10 minutes.

Nonetheless, you must realise that pre-emptible VMs are only going to live for up to maximum 24 hours and that you only get a 30 second notification before the machine is terminated. Hence, pre-emptive VMs are not for every use case but they are still hugely cost-effective for most projects if deployed correctly.

There are also some operational caveats that you must keep in mind when contemplating pre-emptive VMs. For example, when you use pre-emptive VMs, there are no live migrations possible nor are automatic restarts, as that would defeat the purpose. However, there are some techniques we can highlight, which are actually useful in re-spawning terminated pre-emptive VMs. These techniques typically require instance monitoring and the use of load balancers that can start up new pre-emptible VMs in case of failure.

One valuable use case for using pre-emptible VMs is when running a batch processing job. During processing, but the analytical task may well slow down, but it does not completely stop. Therefore, you can economically deploy pre-emptible instances to complete your batch processing tasks. Not only does this save money, but it doesn't place additional workload on your existing instances and doesn't require you to pay full price for additional normal instances.

Region and Zones
After you select the machine type, the next question you will contemplate is where you want to host the VM. Therefore, the first thing you need to consider when choosing a region and zone is the geographical location, which is closest to your customer base as that is where you want to run your resources for lowest latency and highest customer experience.

When selecting a region and zone, it's essential to consider the geographical location closest to your customer base. This will ensure that your resources are accessible at the lowest latency and provide the best possible customer experience.

        <pre><p><strong>Optimizing Compute Engine Resources with Machine Types</strong></p>
<p>When running custom instances on Compute Engine, it's essential to understand how machine types work and how to optimize resource usage. The platform aggregates CPU and memory resources across all instances, then applies sustained usage discounts based on the total usage.</p>
<p>To maximize savings, consider using pre-emptible VMs, which offer a 80% discount compared to normal VMs. However, be aware of the drawbacks: these VMs can be preempted or terminated at any time, and there's no charge if termination occurs within the first 10 minutes. Pre-emptible VMs are not suitable for every use case but can be cost-effective when deployed correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Considerations</strong></p>
<p>When using pre-emptible VMs, keep in mind that live migrations and automatic restarts are not possible. Instead, consider techniques like instance monitoring and load balancers to re-spawn terminated instances. One valuable use case is running batch processing jobs, where some instances may terminate during analysis but can still complete the task.</p>
<p><strong>Region and Zone Selection</strong></p>
<p>When choosing a region and zone for your VM, consider geographical location to minimize latency and maximize customer experience. The closest region to your customer base should be selected to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use pre-emptible VMs to optimize resource usage and save up to 80% on normal VM costs.</li>
<li>Be aware of the drawbacks: preempted or terminated instances may incur no charge within the first 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Consider techniques like instance monitoring and load balancers to re-spawn terminated instances.</li>
<li>Run batch processing jobs on pre-emptible VMs to complete tasks while minimizing additional workload and cost.</li>
