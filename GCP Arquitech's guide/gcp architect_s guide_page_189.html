<h1>Deployment Manager Overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>What is Deployment Manager?</h3>
<h4>Deployment Manager is a service that automates the deployment of applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</h4>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templates</strong>: Templates can be nested to create reusable assets.</li>
<li>Example: Using different templates for firewall rules and virtual machines.</li>
<li><strong>Properties and Environment Variables</strong>: Templates have properties and can use environment variables.</li>
<li><strong>Startup Scripts and Metadata Capabilities</strong>: Templates support startup scripts and metadata capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>GCP API Updates</strong>: Deployments can be updated using the GCP API, and resources can be added or removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloud Launcher</h2>
<h3>What is Cloud Launcher?</h3>
<h4>Cloud Launcher is a marketplace for third-party vendors to sell their cloud-ready products.</h4>
<h4>Vendors have created deployment scripts for common solutions such as LAMP stacks and proprietary software.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Source vs. Licensed Software</strong>: Not all vendor software is open source, and some have separate fees for licensing and image use.</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Monthly Fees</strong>: Estimated monthly fees are available in the pricing details for each solution.</li>
<li><strong>Image Updates</strong>: Google updates images to the latest versions in the repository but does not apply update patches on running instances.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<h4>Cloud Launcher is easy to use, with deployment possible in around 30 seconds with two clicks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selecting the software package and launching on Compute Engine.</li>
<li>Selecting the zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configuration Size</strong>: Neither original nor expanded configurations can exceed 10 megabytes.</li>
<li><strong>System Calls</strong>: Python templates cannot make system or network calls, as these will be automatically rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further Learning</h2>
<h4>This high-level overview does not do justice to the complexity of Deployment Manager's configurations and templates.</h4>
<h4>There is a vast amount more to learn before becoming skilled in using Deployment Manager.</h4></pre>

      <div id="txt" class="tab">

        <pre>Neither your original configuration nor your expanded configuration can exceed 10 megabytes. In addition, you must bear in mind that any configurations that you upload into Deployment Manager will be limited by the constraints based on the amount of time the configuration will take to run and the resources used, i.e., the amount of processing power used during the operation.

An important caveat to be aware of is that if you use Python templates, then you must not make any system or network calls, as these templates will automatically be rejected.

Deployment Templates
Some of the basic features of Deployment Manager's templates are:
Templates can be nested so you can create a set of reusable assets. For example, you could use different templates for firewall rules than you would for virtual machines. Segregating the different components that you might want to set up allows you to update them independently without having to use one single master file.
Templates have properties and can use environment variables.
Templates support startup scripts and metadata capabilities.

Deployments can be updated using the GCP API, and you can add resources or remove resources.

Cloud Launcher
Cloud Launcher is basically a marketplace for third-party vendors to sell their cloud-ready products. The vendors on GCP have already created, tested, and verified their own deployment scripts for their application, software stacks, and cloud tools, based on Deployment Manager.
It is essentially a marketplace to quickly deploy common solutions such as complete open-source LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stacks or licensed versions of proprietary software such as SAP, Salesforce, or Oracle DB.

Not all the vendor software within Cloud Launcher is open source, and some have separate fees for software licensing and image use. However, all estimated monthly fees are available in the pricing details for each solution. But beware, as these are only estimates of the vendor's monthly fees; you will still have Google's data and resource charges to factor in to the billing.

The image fee versus licensing fees are up to the vendor of the solution, but Google does update the images to the latest versions in the repository and applies any update patches but not on running instances.

Cloud launcher is very easy to use to deploy software packages and stacks, literally done with two clicks: one to select the software package and launch on Compute Engine, another to select the zone. At it will be done in around 30 seconds. It is that painless.

Summary
This high-level overview to Deployment Manager does not by any means do it justice. There is a vast amount more to learn before you become skilled in using Deployment Manager's configurations and templates.
