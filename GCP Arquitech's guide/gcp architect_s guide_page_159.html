        <pre><h1>Google Cloud VPN</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To establish a VPN does not require any hardware devices in the Google Cloud as there is no actual VPN device on the Google side as any compatibility issues running your VPN between your existing it is purely software defined. Therefore, you should not experience of IKE (Internet key Exchange) protocol.</p>
<h2>Benefits for Small Organisations</h2>
<p>Using a VPN to interconnect your on-premises network with y GCP virtual private cloud is ideal for small organisations or those starting out perhaps with just a development VPC to test the waters. After all it is secure and as it connects over the network it can be configured and setup anywhere in the world where there is internet access.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>A VPN is a good starting point for a secure interconnect as it is very convenient or at least to start with. However, there are some significant issues that may arise when you start to grow your GCP network and then interconnect it with your on-premises network.</p>
<h3>Network Routing Issues</h3>
<p>The thorny issue here is that of network routing. For traffic to flow between subnets on both sides of the VPN they need to know about one another's existence. This is easy to start off with as you will only need to exchange subnet information for a few subnets on configuring a few static routes to let the routing process know that either side of the VPN tunnel.</p>
<p>However, as the two networks gradually merge then static routes to subnets become unwieldy and do not scale well. This is because with static routing, updating the tunnel requires the addition of adding all the static routes for each on-premises subnet to GCP. It also requires adding routes for every existing subnet in GCP for the on-premises network. That is bad enough but any new subnet will also need to be added before it can interconnect and the VPN tunnel restarted to include the new subnet. This is not really sustainable.</p>
<h2>Cloud VPN Gateways</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Platform offers two types of Cloud VPN gateways, HA VPN and Classic VPN.</p>
<h3>Classic VPN Gateway</h3>
<p>The legacy type is called a classic VPN gateway and it has a single interface, a single external IP address, and it supports tunnels using static routing.</p>
<h3>High Availability VPN (HA VPN)</h3>
<p>The second type of VPN that you can create is called a High-Availability VPN (HA VPN) and it lets you securely connect your on-premises network to your GCP Virtual Private Cloud network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.</p></pre>

        <pre>To establish a VPN does not require any hardware devices in the Google Cloud as there is no actual VPN device on the Google side, as any compatibility issues running your VPN between your existing infrastructure it is purely software defined. Therefore, you should not experience of IKE (Internet key Exchange) protocol. The IKE protocol is used, on-premise hardware and the GCP as it supports standard versions between gateways, to establish the tunnel via the exchange of secret keys for encryption. Hence IKE is crucial for building the secure encrypted tunnel between the parties.

Using a VPN to interconnect your on-premises network with your GCP virtual private cloud is ideal for small organisations or those starting out perhaps with just a development VPC to test the waters. After all, it is secure and as it connects over the network it can be configured and setup anywhere in the world where there is internet access.

A VPN is a good starting point for a secure interconnect as it is very convenient or at least to start with. However, there are some significant issues that may arise when you start to grow your GCP network and then interconnect it with your on-premises network. As we said earlier, a VPN is ideal for creating a research and development area or a DevOps lab in GCP where there is going to be limited access from other departments or areas within the on-premises network.

The thorny issue here is that of network routing. For traffic to flow between subnets on both sides of the VPN, they need to know about one another's existence. This is easy to start off with as you will only need to exchange subnet information for a few subnets on configuring a few static routes to let the routing process know that either side of the VPN tunnel. This is typically done through anything for those specific subnets are to be sent over the VPN tunnel.

However, as the two networks gradually merge, then static routes to subnets become unwieldy and do not scale well. This is because with static routing, updating the tunnel requires the addition of adding all the static routes for each on-premises subnet to GCP. It also requires adding routes for every existing subnet in GCP for the on-premises network. That is bad enough, but any new subnet will also need to be added before it can interconnect and the VPN tunnel restarted to include the new subnet. This is not really sustainable.

Classic and High Availability VPN
Google Cloud Platform offers two types of Cloud VPN gateways, HA VPN and Classic VPN. The legacy type is called a classic VPN gateway and it has a single interface, a single external IP address, and it supports tunnels using static routing. The second type of VPN that you can create is called a High-Availability VPN (HA VPN) and it lets you securely connect your on-premises network to your GCP Virtual Private Cloud network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.

        <pre><p><strong>Establishing a Secure VPN Connection with Google Cloud Platform</strong></p>
<p>To establish a VPN connection with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), no hardware devices are required, as the process is purely software-defined. This means that compatibility issues and IKE protocol usage are minimized.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal for Small Organizations or Development Environments</strong></p>
<p>A VPN is an ideal starting point for secure interconnects, especially for small organizations or those just starting out with a development VPC to test their waters. It provides security and flexibility in configuring the setup anywhere in the world where internet access is available.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Concerns and Network Routing Issues</strong></p>
<p>However, as GCP networks grow and more organizational functions are moved onto the platform, significant issues arise. One of the main concerns is network routing, which becomes unwieldy and unscaleable with static routing. Updating the tunnel requires adding all static routes for each on-premises subnet to GCP, as well as routes for every existing subnet in GCP.</p>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Platform VPN Gateways</strong></p>
<p>To address these issues, Google Cloud Platform offers two types of Cloud VPN gateways: Classic VPN and High Availability VPN (HA VPN). The Classic VPN gateway supports tunnels using static routing, while the HA VPN gateway provides a secure connection through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations for VPN Setup</strong></p>
<p>When setting up a VPN with GCP, it's essential to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network routing and scalability</li>
<li>Static routes and subnet information exchange</li>
<li>IKE protocol usage and compatibility issues</li>
<li>Growing organizational functions and network growth</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these considerations and choosing the right VPN gateway, organizations can establish a secure and scalable VPN connection between their on-premises network and GCP virtual private cloud.</p></pre>
