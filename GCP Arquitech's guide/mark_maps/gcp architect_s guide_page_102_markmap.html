        # Ingress and Firewall
        ## Allow Rules
        - • Ingress allow rules, allow specified protocol, ports, and IP addresses to connect in
        - • The firewall prevents instances from receiving connections on non-permitted ports and protocols
        
        ## Source Protection
        - Rules can be restricted to only affect particular sources
        - Source CIDR ranges can be used to protect from undesired connections coming to an instance either from external networks or from GCP IP set of ranges
        - In addition, source tags can be used to protect an instance from undesired connections coming from specific VM instances that are tagged with a matching tag.
        
        ## Load Balancing
        - The GCP offers a variety of ways to load balance in-bound (ingress) traffic from sources across the internet.
        - You can use the default Global HTTPS load balancing service to put your Web application behind a single anycast IP address across the entire Internet.
        - Load balancing is tightly integrated with GCP's Content Delivery Network, giving you the option to cache many types of content close to your regional customers around the globe.
        
        ## Regional Load Balancers
        - For UDP traffic or for the SSL Proxy, you will also use the regional load balancer.
        - Finally, to load balance the internal ingress traffic within the VPC for example between tiers of a multi-tier application you will use the internal load balancer.
