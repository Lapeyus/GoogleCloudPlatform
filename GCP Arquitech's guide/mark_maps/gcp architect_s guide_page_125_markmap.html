        # IAM Roles
        ## Types of IAM Roles
        - Roles are task related bundles of necessary permissions, which defines who can do what on which resource. There are three specific types of roles in Cloud IAM; primitive roles, curator roles, and custom roles.
        
        ### Primitive Roles
        - The most basic are the primitive roles and these are the original roles that were available in the GCP console. Specifically, these are the owner, editor, and the viewer roles.
        #### Owner Role
        - Full administrative access
        - Ability to add and remove members and delete projects
        
        #### Editor Role
        - Modify permission in conjunction with read access permission
        - Suitable for a developer or operator that needs to deploy applications and modify or configure resources
        
        #### Viewer Role
        - Read-only access
        - Cannot modify any resource
        - Suitable for an edit, manager, or project leader for audit purposes
        
        ### Concentric Roles
        - All of these roles are concentric. This means the higher role includes the permission of the lower roles.
        - Owner role is inclusive of all the permissions of the editor role
        - Editor role is inclusive of all the permissions of the viewer role
        
        #### Billing Administrator Role
        - Used to manage billing and add or remove administrators
        - Suitable for a manager or project leader
        
        ### Curated Roles
        - In addition to the primitive roles, Cloud IAM also provides additional more granular curated or pre-configured roles that give more refined access control to specific GCP resources. Granular roles also reduce the risk of inadvertently providing unwanted access to other resources.
        
        #### Examples of Curated Roles
        - Not specified in the provided text
        
        ## Best Practice for IAM Roles
        - The best practice recommends using groups instead of individual users for managing permissions.
        - Create a DevSecOps group for your development and security operations team that has multiple roles
        - Grant the security admin role to manage firewalls, and the log viewer role for auditing
        - Adding new members to the group is more convenient and less error-prone than assigning roles individually
        
        #### Exceptions
        - For high-risk areas, assign roles to individuals directly rather than using groups.
