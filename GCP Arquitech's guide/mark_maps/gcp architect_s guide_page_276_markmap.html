        # Cloud Pricing Strategies
        ## Understanding the Costs
        - Is the cost of additional reliability worthy of the additional network charges?
        - Pricing following diligent capacity planning can perhaps help you decide.
        
        ## Google Cloud Platform Mechanisms
        - Why cloud pricing is important?
        - Google cloud platform has a number of built mechanisms to help you in keeping on top of costs, one of the most notable  is virtual machine dimensioning.
        - We have already mentioned  the standard machine type discount, but GCP also have inferred  type discounts, sustained-use discounts, and there are inferred  instance discounts.
        
        ### Customizing VMs
        - Typically users will pick a standard  template for a VM but you can use custom VM that you  optimize for high memory or for more CPUs.
        - But some  special purpose VM may need things like GPUs or TPUS for machine learning  purposes.
        - Hence VMs may be customized to match your workload but of course then they would not match  any standard machine type discount.
        
        ### Inferred Type Discounts
        - Google though has provided a work  around for this anomaly via the inferred type discount.
        - The way this work is that Google will calculate how often and for how many hours you've used a particular type of VM.
        - Then they will try to  match it to a similar standard lower cost configurations and give you a discount at the end of the year.
        
        ### Committed Use Discounts
        - There is also committed use discounts, which are a pre-pay model
        - where you commit use as
        - Flex, Dataproc, so on and so forth.
        - period.
        - Therefore you can use any configuration it doesn't matter so long  as you meet your obligations on core use you will get a  fixed discount  for  anywhere from one year to three years depending  on how  much you'll  commit to.
        
        ### Pre-emptible VMs
        - Another interesting  way to  lower costs is  to use pre- emptible VMs.
        - In  case you don't know a pre-emptible VM is one that  you allow  GCP to terminate if they  require the  resources during peak demand  and they are  shutdown with 30 second  notification.
        - Furthermore , the  VM is guaranteed to be terminated  within  24 hours if  you're not preempted.
        - That doesn't sound very attractive so  they give you an 80% discount to encourage you to use them.
        
        ### Pre-emptible VMs in High Availability
        - The  thing is though  sometimes pre-emptive VMs  are very attractive because  they can fit in nicely  into  your design and save you money.
        - you've already built in the ability for fault-tolerance and failover.
        - In For example  if you are building a highly available environment this case you  might as well use the pre-emptive VMs as not only will you get the 80 % discount but you will also have an inbuilt continuous  fail-over test environment.
        
        ## Optimizing Disk Costs
        - When it comes to pricing for storage it is really driven by whether you are chasing performance  or  capacity.
        - This is  another trade-off, as high performance  SSD is certainly more expensive as it costs more per gig (capacity), but it's a much lower price for IOPS (performance).
        - Trying to find a balance that matches your budget is typically driven more by the technical capacity/performance demands of the design and the system properties more than the pricing but you can make savings here when neither is critical.
