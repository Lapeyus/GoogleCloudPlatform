        # IP Addresses
        ## Internal IP Addresses
        - Every VM that you make and any service that depends on virtual machines gets an internal IP address.
        - The internal IP address is allocated via DHCP internally and is used as an internal IP address.
        - The internal IP address can change as it's assigned dynamically by DHCP.
        
        ## External IP Addresses
        - The external IP address is optional.
        - You would only need to assign an external IP address if your device or machine is accessed publicly over the internet.
        - The public or external IP address can either be assigned from a pool, making it dynamic and ephemeral or it can be statically assigned a reserved external IP address.
        
        ### Ephemeral vs Static External IP Addresses
        - Whether you use an ephemeral or static IP address, the external address is unknown to the OS of the VM.
        - The external IP address is mapped to the VM's internal address transparently by VPC.
        
        ## DNS and External IP Addresses
        - Each VM instance has a symbolic name, used as the hostname, which can be resolved by DNS to an internal IP address.
        - The DNS service translates web URLs and VM names of hosts in the same network.
        - However, it cannot translate hostnames from VMs in a different network.
        
        ### Public DNS Records
        - The public DNS records pointing to instances are not published automatically.
        - By default, an admin has to publish these using existing DNS servers.
