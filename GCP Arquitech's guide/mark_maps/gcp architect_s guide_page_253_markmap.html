        # IoT Architecture on Google Cloud Platform
        ## Introduction
        - When it comes to demonstrating the power and utility of GCP, a very good use case is when building IoT architecture. The Internet of Things (IoT) is not just about connecting sensors and manageable devices to the cloud in a scalable fashion although that in itself is challenging. It is also about ingesting, processing, and analyzing sometimes vast amounts of real-time data.
        
        ## Requirements
        - To build an effective IoT cloud architecture, we need to consider the following requirements:
        
        ### Real-Time Data Streaming and Processing
        
        *   **Machine Control Data**: Signals that monitor and control the speed of a motor require instant processing.
        *   **Real-Time Data Analysis**: IoT devices generate vast amounts of data constantly from machine, systems, and processes.
        
        ### Batch Processing
        
        *   **Quality Control Data**: Can be analyzed at leisure to improve the process.
        *   **Data Storage**: Requires batch processing for efficient storage and analysis.
        
        ## Architecture Components
        - The following components will make up the physical aspects of an IoT network:
        
        ### Cloud Services
        
        - | Service | Description |
        - | --- | --- |
        - | GCS (Google Cloud Storage) | Data Storage |
        - | GCF (Google Cloud Functions) | Real-Time Data Processing |
        - | Load Balancer | Scalable Load Balancing |
        - | HTTPS Load Balancer | Secure Load Balancing |
        
        ### Networking Components
        
        - | Component | Description |
        - | --- | --- |
        - | Shared VPC | Scalable Network Architecture |
        - | Private Subnet 1 | Secure Data Storage |
        - | Private Subnet 2 | Secure Data Processing |
        - | Multi-Interfaces | Flexible Network Configuration |
        
        ## Chapter 26-Building an Architecture for IoT
        - This chapter will describe how to build a robust IoT cloud architecture using GCP services.
        
        ### Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0
        
        - Interconnectivity between sensors, devices, and systems is fundamental to extracting and ingesting data for further processing and analysis in IIoT and Industry 4.0.
        
        ### DevOps and Peered Networks
        
        *   **DevOps**: Ensures efficient deployment and management of IoT applications.
        *   **Peered Networks**: Enables secure communication between IoT devices and the cloud.
        
        ### Partnerships and Chapter Summary
        
        - Partnerships with industry leaders are crucial for building a robust IoT ecosystem. This chapter concludes by summarizing the key components of an effective IoT architecture on GCP.
