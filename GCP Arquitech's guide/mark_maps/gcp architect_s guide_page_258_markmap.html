        # Google Cloud IoT Core
        ## Overview
        - Cloud IoT Core is a fully managed service designed to:
        - • Help connect, manage, and ingest data from globally dispersed devices.
        - • Easily and securely ingest event streams from anywhere, at any scale, for simple, reliable, real-time stream analytics.
        
        ### Features
        #### Protocol Bridges
        - • MQTT and HTTP protocol bridges that devices can use to connect to Google Cloud Platform.
        
        #### Device Manager
        - A device manager for registering devices with the service, so you can then monitor and configure them.
        
        ## Process
        - This is the stage where we will have to clean and store data for on-demand solutions that scale.
        ### Data Processing
        - • Apply data extract transform and load (ETL) data with Cloud Dataflow.
        - • Use Cloud Functions as a serverless solution for developers to create single-purpose independent functions that respond to specified events.
        
        #### Storage Options
        - • Cloud Bigtable: ideal for storing very large amounts of single-keyed data with very low latency.
        - • Cloud Storage: used for storing and accessing unstructured data objects on Google Cloud Platform.
        
        ## Analyse
        - With Google cloud IoT platform we can analyse, predict outcomes and generate insightful actionable intelligence.
        ### Key Service Modules
        #### BigQuery
        - A highly scalable enterprise data warehouse that enables you to perform OLAP style queries on large data sets.
        
        #### Cloud Machine Learning (ML) Engine
        - A managed service, which enable you to build and access machine learning models.
