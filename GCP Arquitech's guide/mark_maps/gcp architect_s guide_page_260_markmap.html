        # Cloud Migration Benefits
        
        ## Scalability and Agility
        - The ability to scale up and down as required is very appealing to nearly all teams across the organisation at it eliminates the burden of carrying surplus capacity, as well as provides more agility.
        
        ## Visibility and Governance
        - Despite existing concerns with governance in the cloud in general, GCP's features and tools can offer even more visibility, and thus provide better governance into the IT ecosystem. Indeed increased visibility saves on the proliferation of storage buckets and unnecessary running instances.
        
        ## Cost Effectiveness
        - The major cost benefits that a cloud migration could bring a company, particularly start-ups is well understood as it can significantly reduce capital expenditure on hardware but so can virtualisation however it is the operation expenditure that is not so easily understood. Virtualisation does not reduce the operational, maintenance, management and provisioning cost overheads. Cloud environments does significantly reduce these sometimes significantly if you opt for a fully managed service.
        
        ## Talent and Innovation
        - Google cloud managed services allow IT pros to be less burdened by tedious tasks and housekeeping, which allowed them more time for involvement in projects that produced real business value.
        
        ## Modernisation
        - The migration of systems and data to the cloud is a major project that gives you the chance to re-evaluate applications and their databases. Perhaps some of these are now legacy or even if they still are mission critical systems they could perhaps be due a modernisation. During any system migration project there will be some systems that will require to be re-architected or re-factored to make them suitable for the cloud.
        
        ## Planning the Workload Migration
        - The task of moving enterprise data and applications from inside the secure data center outside into the cloud can be particularly daunting. That is why it must be entered into iteratively in manageable steps following a fully prepared migration strategy. The strategy will differ from organisations in other industry but the core steps should be much the same.
        
        ### Consider Application Suitability
        - Unfortunately not every application is suitable for the cloud and it might require refactoring. It's also important to consider the amount of resources each application uses. The public cloud is a multi-tenant environment, which means applications share resources. And while autoscaling in the public cloud scales resources up or down based on demand, noisy neighbours can be an issue.
        
        ### Evaluate Costs
        - Evaluate costs and consider the potential impact on operation expenditure. Cloud environments can significantly reduce these sometimes significantly if you opt for a fully managed service.
