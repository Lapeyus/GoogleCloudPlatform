        # App Engine Environments
        ## Standard Environment
        ### Caveats
        - Runs in a Sandbox
        -   - Software and security construct that enforces independence of hardware, operating system, file system, or physical location of the server it runs on
        -   - Enforces segregation and isolation of code
        - Constraints:
        -   - Application can't write to local file system
        -   - Must use database service for persistent data storage (Cloud Datastore)
        -   - Requests have a 60-second timeout
        -   - Can't install arbitrary third-party software in sandbox
        
        ### Roadmap
        - 1. Develop application locally using App Engine SDK
        - 2. Deploy application using SDK commands
        - 3. Each App Engine application runs in a GCP project
        - 4. App Engine automatically provisions server instances and scales/load balances them
        - 5. Application can make calls to various services using dedicated APIs
        
        ## Flexible Environment
        ### Differences from Standard Environment
        - Instead of using a sandbox, runs application inside Docker containers on Google Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs)
        - Allows specifying container for App Engine to run in
        - App Engine manages Compute Engine virtual machines for you
        - VMs are monitored, health-checked, healed as necessary
        - Select geographical region for VMs to run in
        
        ### Features
        - App Engine applies critical backward-compatible updates to operating systems automatically
        - Works transparently, allowing focus on code development
