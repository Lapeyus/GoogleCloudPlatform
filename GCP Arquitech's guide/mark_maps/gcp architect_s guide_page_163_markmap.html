        # Google Cloud Interconnect
        ## Overview
        - Google Cloud Interconnect is a service that allows you to connect your network directly to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using dedicated connections.
        
        ### ## Benefits
        
        * Fastest, most reliable, and lowest latency method for interconnectivity
        * Suitable for large organizations with high data transfer requirements
        * Can be used for cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-premises, or on-premises-to-on-premises connectivity
        
        ## ## Requirements
        
        * Familiarity with basic network interconnections
        * Physical presence of a point of presence in a colocation facility
        * Own routing equipment to support the following technical requirements:
        - 	+ Ethernet 10Gbps single-mode fibre
        - 	+ IPv4 link local addressing
        - 	+ LACP for bonding multiple links
        - 	+ EBGP-4 with multihop
        - 	+ 802.1q VLANs
        
        ## ## Use Cases
        
        * Transferring large amounts of data back and forth with Google Cloud Storage
        * Data-intensive production networks requiring high data transfer rates for daily backup
        * High-performance, low-latency, and operationally critical traffic
        
        ## ## Considerations
        
        * Initial setup can take a lot of time and expense
        * Circuit between your network and Google's network is not encrypted (may require additional encryption)
        * Currently, the Google Cloud VPN cannot be used in combination with a dedicated connection
