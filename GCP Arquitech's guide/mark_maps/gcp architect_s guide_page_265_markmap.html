        - 1. Detach the VM.
        
        - 2. Test the application to verify that it functions accurately post-migration.
        
        # Migrate for Compute Engine
        ## Features
        - As an agentless service, there is no impact to the workload.
        - No need to have source instances running to migrate them to GCP.
        - Access to the application remains unchanged or reconfigured.
        - Extensive pre-migration checklists and testing ensure validated instances before moving to GCP.
        
        ## Benefits
        - Rapid migration of single applications saving hours of time and labor.
        - Scaling to 100s of apps using several migration waves, with stateful workloads running in cloud within minutes rather than days.
        - Apps are live up to 100x faster, and migrations complete up to 10x quicker compared to traditional strategies.
        
        ## How MCE Works
        - 1. Validate and perform in-cloud testing on clones to ensure live applications are unaffected.
        - 2. Build pre-planned migration waves containing an application and its dependencies.
        - 3. Deploy workloads to GCP.
        - 4. Background data synchronisation and transfer to GCP, resulting in near zero downtime.
        - 5. Detach and verify, with the option to roll back with no loss of data or project time.
        
        ## Right-Sizing Analytical Tool
        - MCE provides a tool to assist in provisioning and deploying optimal cloud instances for cost and performance.
        
        # Manually Migrating Databases
        - 1. Detach the VM.
        - 2. Test the application to verify that it functions accurately post-migration.
