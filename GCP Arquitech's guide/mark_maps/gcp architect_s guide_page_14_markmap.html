        # Google Cloud Platform
        ## Overview
        - which provides a vast pool of resources that are allocated dynamically to  their clients on a pay-as-you-use basis. That  model allows Google to  dynamically service their customer with  only the resources they require  at any given moment so Google  can get vast efficiencies by  balancing their pool of resources across their demand driven network  of customers. The elastic nature  of the allocation of resources means  that should you quickly  need more resources such as CPU, memory,  network bandwidth  or storage you will get allocated them seamlessly  and rapidly  without any human intervention being required.  However ,  if the demand  were to fall you can then scale back. The consequences of this are that you only pay what you use or reserve so if you no longer use a resource, you
        ## Security
        - Third, Google has their own internet-scale network infrastructure,
        - will no longer be charged for it.
        - Fourth, Security, Google supports a wide array of vendor software and hardware but they also use their own securely built servers. These secure servers have Google's own Titan security chips and secure-boot processes, which makes Google's cloud infrastructure
        - highly secure.
        ## Advantages
        - Fifth, Google like other internet-scale providers takes advantage of economies of scale by buying and building infrastructure, licenses and services in bulk and then passing the savings on to the customers. However, Google has the largest partner network, which manifests itself through a wide array of open-source and proprietary software, which is pre-provisioned and available at a click. Thus, the considerable ease-of-use advantages when provisioning servers and application stacks or environments. What is more each will have the correct versions, dependencies and libraries installed automatically doing away with a lot of the troublesome tasks when deploying stacks. For example, a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack can be provisioned in just a click of a button and the same is true of other environments such as Java. In addition networking becomes easier as it is configured automatically in most cases meaning the requirement for in-house expert-level networking skills is no longer a requirement.
        ## Cost Savings
        - GCP Charging Model
        - A key reason for migrating IT to the Google Cloud Platform is to reduce costs and typically GCP offers several ways to reduce operational spending and overall costs. For start-ups and Greenfield companies cloud computing greatly reduces the capital expenditure required as there are no upfront investments in servers and network equipment. Established businesses however can also benefit by reducing maintenance, administration and operational costs of running a data room/centre. This is primarily due to clouds typical pay-as-you-use model, rapid provisioning of servers, and reduced time to profit in product/service development, which translates to tremendous saving if managed correctly.
