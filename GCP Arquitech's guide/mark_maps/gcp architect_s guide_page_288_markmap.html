        # Istio Integration with Stackdriver
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Monitoring
        - [Stackdriver Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring)
        - Metrics Explorer: view metrics related to services
        - Custom dashboards and alerts for monitoring services over time
        
        ### Logging
        - [Stackdriver Logging API](https://cloud.google.com/logging)
        - Logs viewer: view logs in Stackdriver
        - Export logs to BigQuery (may incur additional costs)
        
        ### Tracing
        - [Stackdriver Trace API](https://cloud.google.com/trace)
        - Distributed tracing for performance bottlenecks
        - Instrument tracing headers in workloads
        
        ## Installation and Configuration
        
        - The Istio installation also lets you add the Istio sidecar proxy (Envoy) to your service workloads, allowing them to communicate with the control plane and join the Istio mesh. However, for clusters with Stackdriver enabled, the Istio Stackdriver adapter is installed along with the core components described above.
        
        ## Benefits
        
        - Tight coupling between Istio and Stackdriver ensures data is sent from service mesh to Stackdriver console by default
        - Enable a particular Stackdriver feature for your project and cluster to get required observability into services' behaviour
