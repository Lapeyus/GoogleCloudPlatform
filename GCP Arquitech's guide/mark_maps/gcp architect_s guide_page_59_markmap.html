        # Containers
        ## What are Containers?
        - The idea of a container is to give you the independent scalability of workloads, but with an abstraction layer of the OS and hardware. Therefore what you effectively get is a VM without a dedicated guest OS.
        
        ### Benefits
        - **Lightweight**: Containers don't require their own guest OS, so they can be created and started quickly.
        - **Isolation**: Containers provide isolation between applications, which helps to prevent conflicts and improves security.
        - **Portability**: Containers are portable across environments, making it easy to deploy applications on different platforms.
        
        ## How do Containers Work?
        - Containers act like a box around your code and its dependencies. They provide a self-contained environment for your application to run in, without the need for a dedicated guest OS.
        
        ### Key Features
        - **File System**: Containers have limited access to their own partition of the file system.
        - **Hardware**: Containers also have limited access to hardware resources.
        - **System Calls**: Containers only require a few system calls to create and start, which means they can be up and running quickly.
        
        ## Use Cases for Containers
        - Containers are ideal for:
        - **Web Applications**: Containers provide a fast and efficient way to deploy web applications.
        - **Microservices Architecture**: Containers help to isolate and scale individual microservices in a distributed application.
        - **DevOps**: Containers simplify the deployment and management of applications in a DevOps environment.
        
        ## Comparison with VMs
        - Containers are similar to virtual machines (VMs) but without the need for a dedicated guest OS. This makes containers more lightweight and efficient than VMs.
        
        ### Key Differences
        - **Resource Usage**: Containers use fewer resources than VMs.
        - **Boot Time**: Containers can be up and running quickly, whereas VMs take longer to boot.
        - **Isolation**: Containers provide isolation between applications, which is not possible with VMs.
