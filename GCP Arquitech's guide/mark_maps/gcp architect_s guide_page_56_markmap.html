        # Cloud SQL
        ## Features
        - • Backup data with On-Demand or scheduled backups.
        - • Scale vertically by changing machine type.
        - • Scale horizontally via read replicas.
        - • Network firewalls, encrypted data on Google's internal networks, and secure temporary files and backups.
        - • Readily accessible to other GCP services and external services.
        - • Supports authorization of Compute Engine instances and low latency high performance.
        
        ## Use Cases
        - Consider using Cloud SQL for relational database support with MySQL or PostgreSQL, especially if vast scale is required.
        
        ## Alternatives
        - Consider using Cloud Spanner for:
        - Horizontal scalability not just through replicas.
        - Transactional consistency at a global scale.
        - Relational schemas.
        - High availability.
        
        # Cloud Spanner
        ## Features
        - • Provide petabytes of capacity.
        - • Offer transactional consistency at a global scale.
        - • Support relational schemas, SQL, and synchronous replication for high availability.
        
        ## Use Cases
        - Natural use cases include financial applications and inventory applications. Consider using Cloud SQL if you require vast scale or full SQL support for an online transaction processing system.
        
        # Cloud Datastore
        ## Features
        - • Highly scalable NoSQL database.
        - • Store structured data from App Engine apps.
        - • Integration point for solutions spanning App Engine and Compute Engine VMs.
        - • Fully managed service with automatic sharding, replication, and scaling.
        - • Offers transactions that can affect multiple database rows and SQL-like queries.
        
        ## Use Cases
        - Use Cloud Datastore as the integration point for your solution.
