        # Migration to Google Cloud
        ## Considerations
        
        - **Load Testing**: Monitor and measure failure scenarios and perform load testing, especially when comparing on-premise to cloud.
        - **Hardware Architecture**: Understand that replacing a physical CPU with virtual cores requires consideration of instruction sets and hardware architecture.
        
        ### Choosing the Right CPU Platform Type
        
        *   Go to Compute Engine > Create VM > Customize
        *   Choose a CPU platform type for optimal performance
        *   Benchmark application running on different processor types to determine benefits
        
        ### OS Image Selection
        
        - **Google's Published Benchmarks**: Compare with Google's published benchmarks or run your own tests to find the most optimal OS image.
        - **Ubuntu vs. Other OS Versions**: Typically, Ubuntu runs better over GCP than other OS versions.
        
        ### Persistent Disk Storage
        
        *   **Standard Persistent Disks**: 10 GB fixed performance
        *   **Increasing Capacity**: Performance increases as storage scales due to Google's quotas
        *   **I/O Bursts**: Consider I/O bursts when trading up for performance over capacity, and choose between faster SSDs or standard HDs.
        
        ### CPU Requirements
        
        - **Capacity Planning**: A higher amount of CPU is necessary to drive larger storage capacity and reap higher disk IOPS.
        - **Bottleneck Prevention**: Ensure enough CPU to drive disk I/O to prevent bottlenecks.
