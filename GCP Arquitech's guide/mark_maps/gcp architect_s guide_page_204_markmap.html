        # Kubernetes Engine Clusters
        ## Advantages
        - Can scale automatically to meet demand, saving on unused nodes and reducing waste.
        - Using pre-emptive VMs (PVM) can provide significant cost savings for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads.
        
        ## Disadvantages
        - PVMs are only available for up to 24 hours and have a limited lifespan.
        - Designing two pools of nodes, one with standard VMs and the other with PVMs, is often necessary to ensure availability.
        
        ## Features
        ### Lists
        - **strong** Autoscaling works well with PVMs, allowing for spin-up of replacements or standard VM nodes as needed.
        - *italic* PMVS with GPUs can become affordable due to large discounts (approx. 50%).
        - `inline code` Estafette GKE Pre-emptible Killer is an open-source solution that spreads out the termination of PVMs, preventing simultaneous deletion.
        
        ### Blocks
        ```js
        - console.log('hello, JavaScript');
        ```
        
        ## Use Cases
        ### Kubernetes Engine Clusters
        #### Deployment Considerations
        - When deciding which Cloud Platform to deploy a containerized application, consider:
        - **Kubernetes Engine**: Ideal for control over VM resources and Docker image development.
        - **App Engine-Flex**: Suitable for flexible and scalable applications.
        - **Compute Engine**: Good choice when absolute control over VM resources is required.
        
        #### Solution
        - Advise developers to weigh the pros and cons of each platform, considering their specific needs and requirements.
