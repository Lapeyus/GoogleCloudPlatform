        # Securing Your Data
        
        ## Access Control
        ### Cloud IAM
        - Assign roles to users for authentication and authorization
        - Roles inherit permissions from project to bucket to object
        - Use ACLs for finer control over specific users
        
        ### Access Control Lists (ACLS)
        - Define who has access to buckets and objects
        - Define what actions can be performed (e.g. read, write)
        
        ## Versioning
        - Turn on object versioning to keep track of modifications
        - List archived versions of an object
        - Restore an object to an older state or permanently delete a version
        
        ### Life-Cycle Management Policies
        - Keep only the three most recent versions of each object
        - Delete objects older than 365 days or before a certain date
        
        ## Storage Classes
        ### Regional vs. Multi-Regional
        - Regional storage: cheaper, less redundancy
        - Multi-regional storage: more expensive, higher redundancy
        
        #### Regional Storage
        - Create bucket in a specific GCP region (e.g. US Central)
        - Store data in the chosen region for high performance and lower cost
        
        #### Nearline and Coldline Storage
        - Designed for infrequent access (backup and archival storage)
        - Priced accordingly, with nearline being more expensive than coldline
