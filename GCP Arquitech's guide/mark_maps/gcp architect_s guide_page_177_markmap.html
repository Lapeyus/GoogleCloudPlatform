        # Regional Load Balancing
        ## Network Load Balancing
        ### Overview
        - Network load balancing allows you to balance the load of your systems based on incoming IP protocol data such as the address, port, and protocol type.
        
        #### Benefits
        - Distributes traffic across a pool of servers.
        - Uses traffic forwarding rules to determine which server to connect to within the target pool.
        - Defines health checks for instances in the target pool.
        
        ### Regional Load Balancing vs Proxy Load Balancers
        - Network load balancing is regional and non-proxy, meaning it's available across multiple zones and doesn't terminate connections from clients.
        - It provides a way to load balance UDP traffic on non-standard ports, which are not supported by global SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancers.
        
        #### Example Use Case
        - You can use network load balancing to replicate a 3-tier application on the cloud. Each instance could be an Apache webserver, a PHP application server, or a MySQL back-end.
        
        ### How it Works
        - 1. The load balancer receives TCP/IP traffic coming in through the internet at the regional level.
        - 2. It redirects traffic across multiple zones via forwarding rule protocols based on IP address, port, or protocol.
        - 3. Before forwarding traffic, the load balancer checks against firewall rules to ensure they don't deny forwarding.
        - 4. If the traffic is not denied, it's forwarded to the designated target pool and its appropriate VM instance.
        
        ### Additional Features
        - Fail over mechanism: Set up a fail over target pool that exists elsewhere in another zone for redundancy and business continuity purposes.
        - Continuous deployment model: Apply the redundant environment to a continuous deployment model.
