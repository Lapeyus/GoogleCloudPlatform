        # Interconnectivity
        ## When You Need It
        - GCP also offers a variety of ways for you to interconnect your on-premises or other cloud networks with your Google VPC. 
        - It's simple to set up a VPN but you will have to manually update the routing add subnets.
        
        ### Using Cloud Router
        - But if you want to use dynamic routing so that all new subnets will be auto-discovered and propagated then you will need to use, cloud router.
        - This option makes the update of routing tables dynamic as it will manage the BGP routing updates between your site and the GCP.
        
        ## Peering with Google
        - You can also peer with Google, through many worldwide points of presence either directly or through a carrier partner. 
        - Or if you need a service level agreement and can adopt one of their required network topologies, then you are best to use the Dedicated Interconnect.
        
        ### Network Billing
        #### Ingress and Egress Traffic
        - It is important that you understand the usage conditions you will be billed for on GCP's network;
        - â€¢ First of all, ingress or traffic coming into GCP's network is not billable it's free of charge. 
        - In addition, all egress traffic within the same zone, to a different GCP service within the same region, or to other Google products like YouTube, Maps, Drive, and Gmail from a VM in GCP with a public or private IP address is not charged either.
        
        #### Egress Traffic Charges
        - However, there is a charge for egress between zones in the same region and between regions.
        - These rules apply to charges only for egress traffic through internal IP addresses.
        
        #### External IP Addresses
        - It is important to realise that there are different billing charges for egress through external IP address, regardless of whether the instances are in the same zone. 
        - Hence there is no free transfer of egress traffic between VMs in the same zone when using public external IP addresses.
        
        ## Designing Your Network
        - Another thing to consider when designing your network is your throughput and round-trip latency between virtual machines.
        - This is going to vary by location, so check your applications requirements against the current specifications for the VPC when choosing where to place the VMs.
        
        ### Performance Comparison
        - For example, VM to VM communication within a single zone has much more consistent performance than VM to VM communication between regions across continents.
