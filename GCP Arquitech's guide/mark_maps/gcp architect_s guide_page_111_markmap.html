        # Compute Engine Roles
        ## Overview
        - Compute Engine roles provide access to various features and functionalities within the platform.
        
        ### Roles
        - **roles/compute.networkUser**: Provides access to a shared VPC network once granted, service owners can use VPC networks and subnets that belong to the host project.
        - **roles/compute.orgSecurityPolicyAdmin**: Full control of Compute Engine Organization Security Policies.
        - **roles/compute.storageAdmin**: Permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots.
        
        ### Combining Roles
        - Roles can be combined to give users or groups specific permissions. For example, granting roles/compute.networkAdmin and roles/compute.securityAdmin allows a networking team to manage networks and apply firewall rules.
        
        # VM Lifecycle
        ## Overview
        - Understanding the lifecycle of a VM is crucial for knowing its status at any given time, especially for billing purposes.
        
        ### Stages
        - **Provisioning State**: The initial stage after configuring VM properties. Resources are reserved but the VM itself isn't running.
        - **Staging State**: The next stage where resources are moved from being reserved to acquired and the instance is prepared for launch.
        - **Running State**: Where the VM starts doing useful work, executing pre-configured startup scripts, and enabling SSH or RDP access.
        
        ### Benefits
        - The running state offers flexibility with tasks such as:
        - Moving VMs to different zones
        - Taking snapshots of persistent disks for backup or migration purposes
        - Exporting system images
        - Re-configuring metadata
        
        - However, some admin tasks require stopping the virtual machine.
