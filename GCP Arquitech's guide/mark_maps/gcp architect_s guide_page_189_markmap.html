        # Deployment Manager Overview
        
        ## Introduction
        ### What is Deployment Manager?
        #### Deployment Manager is a service that automates the deployment of applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
        
        ## Features
        
        - **Templates**: Templates can be nested to create reusable assets.
        -   - Example: Using different templates for firewall rules and virtual machines.
        - **Properties and Environment Variables**: Templates have properties and can use environment variables.
        - **Startup Scripts and Metadata Capabilities**: Templates support startup scripts and metadata capabilities.
        - **GCP API Updates**: Deployments can be updated using the GCP API, and resources can be added or removed.
        
        ## Cloud Launcher
        
        ### What is Cloud Launcher?
        #### Cloud Launcher is a marketplace for third-party vendors to sell their cloud-ready products.
        #### Vendors have created deployment scripts for common solutions such as LAMP stacks and proprietary software.
        
        - **Open Source vs. Licensed Software**: Not all vendor software is open source, and some have separate fees for licensing and image use.
        - **Estimated Monthly Fees**: Estimated monthly fees are available in the pricing details for each solution.
        - **Image Updates**: Google updates images to the latest versions in the repository but does not apply update patches on running instances.
        
        ### Ease of Use
        #### Cloud Launcher is easy to use, with deployment possible in around 30 seconds with two clicks:
        -   - Selecting the software package and launching on Compute Engine.
        -   - Selecting the zone.
        
        ## Limitations
        
        - **Configuration Size**: Neither original nor expanded configurations can exceed 10 megabytes.
        - **System Calls**: Python templates cannot make system or network calls, as these will be automatically rejected.
        
        ## Further Learning
        #### This high-level overview does not do justice to the complexity of Deployment Manager's configurations and templates.
        #### There is a vast amount more to learn before becoming skilled in using Deployment Manager.
