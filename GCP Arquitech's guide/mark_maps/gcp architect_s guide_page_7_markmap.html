        # Digital Transformation
        ## Drivers of Change
        - The obvious improvement in on-premises performance and reduced latency between applications encouraged the use of microservices, which are single function modules of code.
        
        - Microservices encouraged the decomposition of monolithic applications as it brought the benefits of faster development and the promise of agile development, continuous improvement through frequent updates and rapid deployment. Now large organisations' business teams were beginning to pay attention.
        
        - Next came containers and this is where the modern cloud technologies and large enterprise data centre technologies would eventually converge on a common architecture. Don't get me wrong though the introduction of microservices, containers and flat networks have made cloud migrations feasible but it is still not easy.
        
        - This is because decomposing a mission critical application into microservices or sharding vast databases into manageable components takes time and effort. However, the rewards are now scalability, flexibility, speed, redundancy, centralised security, global-reach, multi-regional caching, network efficiency and infrastructure cost effectiveness, amongst many others.
        
        ## Business Focus
        - But the drivers now for modernisation or as it is called digital transformation came from the business teams and the c-suite. This turn-around from an IT-push to a C-suite and business-team's pull came-about because the need to modernise to a more pervasive digital, flexible, agile and rapid business environment was now deemed to be business critical.
        
        - This is because the business teams could now translate the cloud benefits to real business objectives such as wider market visibility, better customer identification and personalisation, informed and dynamic decision-making, faster time to market and advanced capability-building.
        
        ## ROI Framework
        - Consequently when framing any questions regards return on investment for moving to the cloud for all but the smallest of companies or startup we should avoid stressing the cost saving benefits. The reason for this is two-fold, one it may not actually be true for larger or well established organizations.
        
        - Two, it is better to concentrate on composite ROI whereby you take a three tier approach. The lower tier would be regards the infrastructure Total-Cost-of Ownership (TCO) and capital investments in modernisation.
        
        - For a startup the value generated at this tier could be significant but for most larger organizations the CapEx and OpEx ratio will typically be neutral or even negative over 3-5 years.
        
        - Then we should consider the second tier which concerns Human Resources (HR) with regards to the operations and maintenance and this is where organisations can make some positive ROI due to offshoring much of the operations, management and maintenance burden and thus reducing staffing, training and administration requirements.
        
        - However, even at this HR tier the ROI is typically only around 5%. It is at the third tier, which measures business value that we will typically see significant return on investment. Indeed when we consider business benefits in the ROI this is where we start to see ROI in excess of 50%.
        
        ## Conclusion
        - Therefore, when considering ROI for moving to the cloud you should take a holistic approach by considering infrastructure, HR and business value to reach a composite value.
        
        - This will require involving the business-teams in technology decision making as well as elevating IT to a become a business function with responsibilities to create business value. After all this is what digital transformation is all about.
