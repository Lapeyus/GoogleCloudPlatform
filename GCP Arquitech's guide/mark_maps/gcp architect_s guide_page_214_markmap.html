        # Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
        ## Understanding SLOs
        - Contrary to popular belief, SLOs aren't set at the maximum performance a service can achieve. Rather, the business will determine an appropriate  and achievable  level of the performance or reliability that the provider can realistically deliver.
        
        ## Importance of Realism
        - After  all the service must be financially viable so we can't make it too  responsive
        - or too available because then it would be too expensive.
        - One important thing is that your SLOs are not immutable and they might change as you continually improve and upgrade  your service .
        
        ## Golden Monitoring Signals
        - Also , keep  in mind the four  golden monitoring signals when creating your SLOS: latency, traffic, errors, and resource  saturation.
        
        - When designing your SLOS, it's important to be realistic  and not over optimistic. While we would all like to think  we have designed a service that is 100 percent reliable and available, that  is sadly rarely the case.
        
        ## Error Budget Methodology
        - This is why many organisations use an error budget methodology when it comes to maintenance and managing service windows.
        - 444
        
        ### Error Budget
        - By taking a realistic approach to maintenance it is assumed that
        - every service will not run
        - perfectly. Hence, services are given
        - acceptable error limits for the SLOS that operate a bit like any financial  budget.
        
        - With an error budget, each service will be  given a set level  of credit which is a set amount of errors, which are measured  in downtime, that are considered acceptable, i.e.  normal and expected  maintenance and service downtime.
        
        - However, any errors in  excess of this budget are considered to be service outages .
        
        - You will commonly see error budgets displayed as  SLAs such as  99.9% and the like.
        
        - Therefore, the goal with an error  budget is to  perform all the system maintenance and updates within this budget .
        
        - The error budget in effect provides a strict window of opportunity  for unscheduled maintenance and servicing.
        
        - Each month there  will be opportunities for implement  changes and applying  updates but as the days go by the error budget is
        - replenished.
        
        ### Service Requirements
        - A key design focus is on the requirements that are important to the stakeholders, for example the business goals.
        
        - Requirements are also measurable for example; one operational requirement might be that the service must be highly responsive to users.
        
        - That requirement is now contained in an objective, such as; the system must respond to customer requests in no more than 400 milliseconds latency.
        
        - The design objective can then be mapped to a corresponding measurable service indicator, such as; measuring round trip time between receiving a user request and delivery of a result to the gateway.
