        # Interconnecting Networks
        ## Overview
        - There are three general ways to interconnect your on-premises or other cloud provider's network to Google's cloud network.
        
        ### Methods of Interconnection
        #### 1. Through an Intermediary
        - Connect through a network service provider that also offers interconnect services.
        
        #### 2. Using Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
        - Use a technology like VPN to create one or more private and secure tunnels through the public internet and connect that way.
        
        #### 3. Via Cloud Router
        - Connect via the internet using cloud router.
        
        ## The Google Network
        ### Overview of Google's Global SDN Network
        - Google Cloud's well-provisioned global SDN network is composed of hundreds of thousands of miles of fibre optic cable and seven destinations across the world, with multiple redundant links.
        
        #### Key Features of Google's Networking Services
        - Supports IP addressing for global, private, as well as regional segmentation.
        - Includes services such as HTTPS, TCP, UDP Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, and Cloud DNS.
        - Enables control over access permissions through Resource Manager and network IAM roles for identity and access management.
        
        ## Benefits of Connecting to Google's Network
        - Inheriting many of Google's own access controls and security measures.
        - Several ways to connect and benefit from Google's robust and secure network infrastructure:
        -   - Using a VPN or Cloud Router (sufficient for most organizations).
        -   - Considering Cloud Interconnect for large scale deployments with heavy ingress and egress traffic.
        -   - Connecting through Direct Peering.
        
        ## Cloud VPN
        ### Overview of Cloud VPN
        - Google Cloud VPN provides a secure communication channel over the internet, connecting your on-premises network to your GCP VPC network through an IPsec VPN connection.
        
        #### Key Features of Cloud VPN
        - Protects traffic with the IPsec protocol, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
        - Ensures all packets are encrypted by one VPN gateway at the tunnel ingress and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway at the tunnel egress.
        - Uses private IP ranges to ensure secure traffic flow between networks when the VPN tunnel is established.
