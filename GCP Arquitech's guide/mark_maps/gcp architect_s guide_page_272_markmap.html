        # Capacity Planning Cycle
        ## Overview
        
        - The capacity planning cycle involves several stages, including forecasting, resource allocation, deployment, monitoring, and iteration.
        
        ### Forecasting
        
        - 1. **Initial Forecast**: Based on project plan, marketing data, or previous industry/product knowledge.
        - 2. **Resource Allocation**: Determine necessary resources and obtain approval.
        - 3. **Deployment**: Deploy resources due to cloud deployments being more influenced by operation expense (OpEx) than upfront capital expense (CapEx).
        
        ### Monitoring and Measurement
        
        - 1. **Testing and Commissioning**: Start monitoring indicators during testing and commissioning.
        - 2. **Real-World Conditions**: Monitor indicators in production, adjusting forecasts and optimizing accordingly.
        
        ### Iterative Forecasts
        
        - 1. **Compare Actuals with Forecasts**: Compare actual measured conditions with forecasts to determine accuracy.
        - 2. **Adjust and Refine**: Adjust forecasts based on previous errors and refine predictions for future growth.
        
        ## Error Budget and Overprovisioning
        
        - 1. **Error Budget**: Include additional resources to cater for unforeseen happenings, known as an error budget.
        - 2. **Overprovisioning**: Allocate a generous amount of capacity to account for unknown overheads and potential cascading failures.
        
        ### Capacity Allocation
        
        - 1. **Instance Overhead Estimation**: Estimate instance overheads, considering production overheads and inherent capacity overheads within a VM.
        - 2. **Capacity Allocation**: Allocate 30% of capacity for partial load, accounting for fail-over in managed instances, and leaving 10% spare capacity to avoid cascading failures.
        
        ## Conclusion
        
        - The capacity planning cycle involves iterative forecasting, resource allocation, deployment, monitoring, and iteration to ensure accurate predictions and optimal resource utilization.
