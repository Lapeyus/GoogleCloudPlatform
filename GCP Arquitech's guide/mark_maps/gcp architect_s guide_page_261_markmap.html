        # Cloud Migration Considerations
        
        ## Costs and Benefits
        
        - Many organizations move to the cloud on the basis that it's more cost efficient. However, cloud migrations are not cheap and although they may eventually reduce hardware and some IT overheads they actually increase operational expenses . Moreover, the increase in application OpEx will differ for each application. This is why it is critical to evaluate an applications suitability for the cloud not just on architecture but on cost efficiency.
        
        ## Governance and Security
        
        - As organizations move data to the cloud, IT's control diminishes as more responsibility is passed onto Google. Therefore , organizations must shape their governance strategies to rely less on internal security and control, and more on Google.
        
        ## Cloud-to-Cloud Migration Challenges
        
        - Cloud migrations aren't just a transition from on-premises technology to the cloud; they can also migrate data from one cloud to another . Additionally, cloud-to-cloud migrations involve considerable manual labour. To prepare for migration from one provider to another, enterprises need to test their applications and make all necessary configurations for virtual machines, networks, operating systems and more.
        
        ## Migration Strategy
        
        - Once you've considered your data, costs, security and the challenges of cloud-to-cloud migrations, it's time to come up with a migration game plan. Organizations also need to determine migration timeframes for their data and applications. While some choose to migrate everything to the cloud all at once, this can be a challenging -- and risky -- proposition. It's often more effective to break the migration down by workload, starting with less critical applications.
        
        ### Developing a Migration Strategy
        
        - Some suggestions for a viable migration strategy are:
        
        - 1. **Leverage cloud resources** for legacy applications when there is opportunity for cost savings for example, Backup, DR, Business Continuity, or for global reach.
        - 2. **Focus your cloud strategy** on new applications that will drive greater agility for the business and contribute to the bottom-line .
        - 3. **Leverage cloud resources** to fill gaps in your on-premises technologies and skills, for example machine learning.
        
        ### Building a Cloud Migration Plan
        
        - When we come to build our cloud migration plan there are three key factors that should guide you through the process. These factors will help determine whether to move on-premises workloads to the public cloud or leave them where they are.
        
        - 1. **Evaluate current infrastructure**
