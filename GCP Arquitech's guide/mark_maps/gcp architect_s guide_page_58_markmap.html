        # Public Cloud Cost Model
        
        ## Understanding the Basics
        
        - The public cloud cost model is a pay-as-you-go pricing structure where users only pay for the resources they use.
        
        ### Key Components
        
        * **Instance Types**: The type of virtual machine or server instance used, which affects compute power and storage.
        * **Storage**: The amount of data stored in the cloud, which can be object storage, block storage, or file storage.
        * **Data Transfer**: The amount of data transferred in and out of the cloud, which can incur additional charges.
        
        ## Moving to CloudSQL
        
        ### Benefits
        
        * Relatively straightforward migration from on-premises MySQL
        * Simple sqldump transfer with minimal downtime
        
        ### Considerations
        
        * Potential for downtime or service disruption during replication
        * Replication ensures synchronisation between on-premises master and CloudSQL instance
        
        # Containers and Kubernetes Engine
        
        ## Introduction to Containers and Kubernetes
        
        ### What are Containers?
        
        - Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies, allowing for efficient deployment and scaling.
        
        ### Benefits of Containers
        
        * Improved application portability
        * Reduced infrastructure overhead
        * Faster deployment and scaling
        
        ## Hybrid Service: Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine
        
        ### Conceptual Model
        
        - The Kubernetes engine sits between the Compute Engine (IaaS) and App Engine (PaaS), providing a hybrid service that leverages benefits from both.
        
        ### Benefits of Hybrid Service
        
        * Automation and elasticity from Compute Engine
        * Self-awareness and dynamic scaling from App Engine
