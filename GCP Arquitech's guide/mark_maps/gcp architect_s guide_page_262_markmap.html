        # Cloud Migration Considerations
        ## Existing Investment
        - There is likely to be significant costs associated with servers and support infrastructure.
        
        ### Servers
        - Servers are likely to be on a hardware lifecycle roadmap, refreshed every 3-5 years. This may be the ideal time to migrate on-premises resources to the cloud.
        
        ## Application Performance and Portability
        - Consider whether the application can function in the cloud. Compatibility and performance are not likely to be a problem in GCP, but latency and portability must be considered.
        
        ### Latency
        - Even with unlimited compute and memory resources, limited internet bandwidth may be detrimental to application performance.
        
        ### Portability
        - Migrating virtualized application servers is not a problem, but external dependencies such as partner data source connections must be considered.
        
        ## Network Assessment
        - Assess the premises network and how it will integrate with the cloud. Consider deploying cloud-based AD domain controllers and DNS.
        
        ### Cloud-Network Integration
        - The cloud network must function for both on-premises and cloud access. This requires a secure communications path between the cloud and on-premises network.
        
        ## Migration Strategy
        - Strive for a lift-and-shift of easy applications and databases early on, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. As experience and confidence grow, migrate more complex applications and databases like Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.
        
        ### Homogenous vs. Heterogeneous Migration
        - A homogenous migration involves migrating similar applications and databases at once. A heterogeneous migration involves migrating different applications and databases separately.
        
        ## Best Practices
        
        * Take your time and look for the best deployment methods on an application-to-application basis.
        * Don't need to lift and shift everything at once.
        * Consider the best deployment methods for each application and database.
