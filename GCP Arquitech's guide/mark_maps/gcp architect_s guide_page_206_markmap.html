        # Design Thinking
        ## Introduction
        - Design thinking is an iterative approach to problem solving that intentionally seeks out people with different perspectives, knowledge, skills and experience and has them work together to create a practical solution for a real-world problem.
        
        ### Key Principles
        - Intentionally seek out diverse perspectives
        - Use a process-based approach to solve problems
        - Identify a solution that is capable of succeeding, can be carried out in a timely manner, is cost effective, fit for purpose, and is likely to be accepted by all stakeholders
        
        ## The 5 Steps of Design Thinking
        ### Step 1: Empathize
        - Start with something rough, a prototype or proof of concept model
        - Focus on getting core functionality working
        - Ask questions about how the design will handle specific scenarios
        
        ### Step 2: Define
        - Get a good grounding of the use case and what you are trying to achieve
        - Identify system's specifications and requirements as well as deliverables
        - Set measurable metrics, known as service level indicators (SLI)
        
        ## Four-Tier Design Methodology
        ### Tier 1: Presentation Layer
        - Address underlying infrastructure and networking
        
        ### Tier 2: Business Logic
        - Plan exactly how the service is going to work
        - Decide which components will provide features and functions
        - Understand different attributes that should be applied to those components
        
        ### Tier 3: Data Layer
        - Store data somewhere
        - Determine if data will be structured or unstructured?
        - Will it be a relational database or static storage?
        
        ## Example Use Case
        ```markdown
        # Use Case
        - Use case: Designing a new service
        
        * Problem statement: How can we design a new service that meets the needs of our users while being cost-effective and scalable?
        * Solution: Use design thinking to identify key principles, define the use case, and apply the four-tier design methodology.
        ```
        
        ## Glossary
        - **Design Thinking**: An iterative approach to problem solving that intentionally seeks out diverse perspectives and uses a process-based approach to solve problems.
        - **Four-Tier Design Methodology**: A framework for designing software applications that consists of four tiers: presentation layer, business logic, data layer, and infrastructure.
