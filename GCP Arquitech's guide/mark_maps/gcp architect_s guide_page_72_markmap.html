        # Serverless, with Service Mesh
        
        ## Introduction
        
        - Serverless computing transforms source code into workloads executed only when called by an event. This approach decouples code from infrastructure, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
        
        ## Key Benefits
        
        ### Decoupling Code from Infrastructure
        
        * Reduces infrastructure costs
        * Increases efficiency
        * Allows developers to focus on writing business value code
        
        ### Heterogeneous Development Environment Support
        
        * GCSM allows Kubernetes users to deploy container applications and serverless functions onto the same cluster
        * Uniform standard methodology between serverless and Kubernetes environments
        
        ## Portability
        
        - Organizations adopt complex cluster configurations for code portability, requiring lower latency, security, and tools spanning both cloud and on-premise. Google's Cloud Services Platform provides an interoperable environment combining solutions like GKE On-Premise, Istio, and Google Kubernetes Engine.
        
        ## Use Case - 8
        
        - Client ABC requests a high-level summary of each service with use-cases. A brief summary can be provided as follows:
        
        ### Summary of Platform Properties
        
        #### App Engine Standard
        - A cost-effective way to host development apps or production platforms for APIs or low throughput apps.
        
        #### Serverless, with Service Mesh
        - Transforms source code into workloads executed only when called by an event.
        * Decouples code from infrastructure
        * Reduces costs and increases efficiency
        * Allows developers to focus on writing business value code
        
        #### Portability
        - Provides an interoperable environment for complex cluster configurations, combining solutions like GKE On-Premise, Istio, and Google Kubernetes Engine.
        
        #### Pros
        * Cost-effective hosting options
        * Uniform standard methodology between serverless and Kubernetes environments
        * Supports heterogeneous development environments
