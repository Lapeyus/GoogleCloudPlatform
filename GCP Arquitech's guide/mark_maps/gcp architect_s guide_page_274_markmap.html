        # Network Capacity
        ## Limitations
        - Network throughput for VMs is limited by CPU cores.
        - Quota is capped at 16 gigs maximum, requiring 8 cores.
        
        ## Ingress vs Egress Traffic
        - 16gigs is not simply the sum of egress and ingress traffic flow.
        - There's another limit on ingress traffic set at 10 gigs.
        
        ## Internal vs External IPs
        - All VMs come with both internal and external IPs.
        - Internal IPs are on a much faster network, reducing latency.
        
        ## Workload Estimation
        - Potential network throughput varies dramatically due to request types.
        - Request types can be very verbose or small but chatty.
        
        # Resource Allocation
        ## Forecasting vs Allocation
        - Forecasting tells us how much capacity we're going to potentially allocate.
        - Allocation tells us how much resource is necessary to provide that capacity.
        
        ## Estimating Resources
        - Validate estimates with load testing.
        - Calculate resources required based on capacity/resource ratio.
        
        ## Example: Video Transcription Service
        - Demand for storage throughput increases by 30%.
        - New QPS is 327,600.
        - Divide QPS by 10,000 to determine Bigtable nodes needed (33).
        
        ## Alternative Approaches
        - Consider enabling caching in Memcache or local SSD.
        - Tune applications and processes to make them more efficient.
        - Explore using better algorithms or alternative services.
