        # Use Case: 1
        ## Business Overview
        - ABC Technology, a start-up business, has sent an RFC (Request for Proposal) for a proposal to accommodate growth, business continuity, and disaster recovery for their entire operation.
        
        ## Current Architecture
        - Their current architecture consists of:
        - On-premises hardware supporting a three-tier web application
        - Three set-ups: production, development/testing, and data storage/archive
        
        ## Proposed Solution
        - As a first stage, propose mirroring their on-premises architecture to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using VMs in Compute Engine.
        
        ### Benefits
        - Quickly prototyped for demonstration
        - Mirrors current architecture with minimal changes
        - Solves business continuity and disaster recovery requirements
        
        ### Cost Effectiveness
        - Requires ascertaining desired level of continuity requirement (RTO)
        -   - How much down-time and data loss can the business accept?
        - Possible to build a warm DR cloud environment if flexible on RTO
        - Not insignificant financial consequences for building entire cloud architecture 24/7
        
        ### Accommodating Growth and Scale
        - Suggest switching to GCP after first stage completion
        - Use on-premises as backup site for local storage and archiving of data
        - Utilize GCP's elasticity and high scalability for automatic hardware scaling
        
        ### Third Stage
        - Retire on-premises data centre altogether
        - Replicate everything in the cloud and mirror infrastructure and storage across two zones or regions
