        # Cloud Routing Service
        ## Introduction
        - Administration of static routes in networking is just too slow, tedious and error prone for managing any large network.
        
        ### Benefits of Dynamic Routing
        - A routing protocol manages the exchange of subnet information dynamically, discovering new subnets and changes to the network topology and then advertising those changes to its routing peer.
        - This allows for a dynamic solution as you outgrow your VPN interconnect as the burden of updating the static routing becomes just too great.
        
        ## Cloud Router Service
        - The Cloud Router service is a managed service that provides dynamic routing and advertising of new networks and topology changes through a routing protocol, similar to on a physical router in the on-premises network.
        - However, the GCP's cloud router is only a virtual router as it is part of Google's SDN (Software Defined network) running the BGP routing protocol.
        
        ### How it Works
        - When you use the cloud router service, you're peering with Google, exchanging dynamic routing information and BGP is auto-discovering the network topology and exchanging information about any existing or new subnets within your VPC.
        - This is especially beneficial if you're peering with GCP from multiple locations.
