        # The Evolution of Cloud Computing
        ## Early Days of Virtualization (1990s-2000s)
        ### Network Issues and Latency
        - Network issues and latency brought about through traditional layer 3 routing made internet providers look towards Software Defined Networks (SDN) and a shift away from virtualization.
        
        ## The Rise of SDN and Container-Based Architecture
        ### Internet-Scale Businesses Adopt SDN
        - Large internet-scale businesses like Google understood that traditional networking and server architecture with virtualisation would not scale to their global demands. Consequently, they switched to a container-based architecture based upon an automated SDN elastic cloud built around automated services.
        
        ## Pioneers of Cloud Computing
        ### Creating Own SDN Global Networks
        - The pioneers of cloud computing such as Google didn't have a vendor roadmap to follow so they created their own SDN global networks and developed their own routers, switches and servers to meet their own world-wide criteria.
        
        ## Shared Resources and the Emergence of Cloud
        ### Amazon's Realization
        - What Amazon in particular realised early on was that their vast pool of resources could now be shared reliably, efficiently and cheaply over the internet just like co-location. This made colocation and in-house virtualisation a poor alternative as cloud became very attractive for small organizations.
        
        ## Software as a Service (SaaS) and Its Impact
        ### Dislocating IT from Desktop Support
        - The CRM platform Salesforce was one of the pioneers and it dislocated IT in many respects from desktop and application support. SaaS also instigated Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
        
        ## IaaS and PaaS: A New Era for Cloud Computing
        ### laaS and PaaS Offerings
        - laaS provided raw compute, storage, and network services that are organized in ways that are far cheaper to provision and more efficient than on-premises servers. PaaS offerings were more suitable for developers that needed a platform on which to run their application code.
        
        ## Adoption of Cloud Computing: Challenges and Benefits
        ### Larger Companies' Reticence
        - Many larger companies thought that giving up control and management of their infrastructure was not an attractive proposition. However, the benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability and cost-effectiveness, eventually won over many organizations.
