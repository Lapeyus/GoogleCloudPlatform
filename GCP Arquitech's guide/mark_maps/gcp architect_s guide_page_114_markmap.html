        # Machine Types Overview
        ## High Memory Machine Types
        - Ideal for applications with high memory requirements relative to virtual CPUs.
        - Start at 6.5 GB of RAM per VCPU, nearly doubling the amount compared to standard types.
        
        ## High CPU Machine Types
        - Suitable for applications demanding more virtual CPUs relative to memory.
        - Start at 0.9 GB of RAM per VCPU.
        
        ## Predefined vs Custom Machine Types
        - Predefined machine types are constantly being evaluated and may change or become unavailable in certain regions.
        - Check the Web Console for availability in your region.
        - If predefined types don't meet compute needs, create a custom machine type to customize CPU, memory, and GPU requirements.
        
        ## Specialist Machine Types for HPC and ML
        - Google provides Compute Optimized (C2) and Memory Optimized (M2) VMs to meet the requirements of High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning (ML) workloads.
        - C2 VMs offer high per-thread performance, increased memory speeds, and improved performance for HPC and gaming applications.
        - M2 VMs provide the highest memory configuration, suitable for memory-intensive workloads like large in-memory databases and data analytics.
        
        ## Custom Machine Type Discounts
        - Custom machines don't fit into a category, making them ineligible for Google's standard machine type discount plan.
        - Compute Engine calculates virtual CPU and memory usage to apply discounts based on sustained user rates.
