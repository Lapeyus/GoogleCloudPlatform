        # Lift-and-Shift Vs. Refactoring
        
        ## Budget
        - Unfortunately, many IT teams face time or budget constraints, leading them to opt for a lift and shift approach. However, refactoring can be a better path, offering significant benefits in basic lift-and-shift migration.
        
        ### On-Premises vs. Cloud-Native
        - Although lift and shift may seem easier and cheaper on-premises, it could ultimately cost more than running a cloud-native app. Additionally, there may be limitations in utilizing Google's services for monitoring, security, and governance.
        
        ## Refactoring as a Better Option
        
        - Refactoring is often preferred over lift and shift due to the following reasons:
        
        *   Performance issues after lift and shift migration
        *   Inability to integrate with Google's security systems, such as IAM
        *   Delays and expense associated with unnecessary refactoring
        
        ### Evaluating Refactoring
        
        - When deciding whether to refactor an application, consider the following factors:
        
        *   Cost: Ensure that refactoring does not exceed the savings in running costs.
        *   Enhanced performance and security benefits
        *   Return on investment (ROI)
        
        ### Refactoring Tools
        
        - A wide variety of refactoring tools are available, catering to different programming languages and databases. Today, most tools focus on building microservices designed to consume cloud-native APIs.
        
        ### Shift Towards Container Development
        
        - Recently, there has been a shift towards container development and Kubernetes engine deployment, making these tools increasingly popular for refactoring applications in the cloud.
        
        ## Refactoring Strategies
        
        - There are two primary approaches to refactoring:
        
        - 1.  **Complete Refactor**: This approach involves editing over 50% of the code and updating the database to benefit from cloud-native features. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can be expensive or complex.
        - 2.  **Minimum Viable Refactoring**: This approach prioritizes speed and efficiency, requiring only minor code changes to the application. It often results in integrating the app with cloud-native security and a cloud database into the migrated workload.
        
        ### Prioritizing Speed and Efficiency
        
        - When choosing a refactoring strategy, consider prioritizing speed and efficiency while still achieving the desired outcomes. This approach can help minimize delays and expense associated with unnecessary refactoring.
