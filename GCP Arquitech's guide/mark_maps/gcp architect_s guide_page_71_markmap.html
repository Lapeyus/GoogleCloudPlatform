        # Google Cloud Service Mesh
        ## Overview
        - Google Cloud Platform has its own GCSM which is a fully managed service that is built on the high-performance Envoy sidecar proxy and the open source Istio service mesh provides the overlay on your microservices running in Kubernetes for container API support.
        
        ### Features
        - **End-to-end encryption**: Supports end-to-end encryption between services using mTLS (mutual TLS)
        - **Granular traffic control**: Provides granular traffic management, routing, and authorization policy
        - **Integration with Stackdriver**: Integrates with Stackdriver to monitor and alert on key metrics
        
        ## Istio on GKE
        ### Overview
        - Istio on GKE provides a managed, mature service mesh that you can deploy that spans both the Cloud and on-premise networks with just one click.
        
        ### Utility
        - The real utility of the Istio service mesh is in the context of the cloud-native ecosystem as it provides a path towards infrastructure abstraction and process automation in a cloud or a hybrid cloud environment.
        
        ## Automation
        ### Overview
        - Organizations are increasingly moving toward automation as it delivers efficiencies, velocity and quality in the development process.
        
        ### Benefits
        - **Continuous improvement**: Strives for continuous improvement and rapid deployment to deliver products
        - **Pipeline-based approach**: Automates application upgrades and rapid deployment through pipeline-based approaches
        
        ### Integration with GCSM
        - Google Cloud Service Mesh based on Istio integrates seamlessly with continuous delivery systems and the deployment pipelines. It can also work with modern GitOps workflows due to its declarative configuration model.
        
        ## Traffic Director
        ### Overview
        - Traffic Director is GCP's fully managed traffic control plane for service mesh.
        
        ### Features
        - **Simple load balancing**: Easy to configure simple load balancing
        - **Global load balancing**: Deploy global load balancing with automatic cross-region overflow and failover
        - **Advanced features**: Enables seamless scalability within Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine environments
