        # Use Case -6
        ## A Client's Dilemma
        
        - A client wants to build apps using containers, embracing a continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. However, their current infrastructure isn't flexible enough, and they're unsure how to manage the change.
        
        ## Solution
        
        - There are two parts to this question:
        
        ### Part 1: Cloud Development Environment
        
        - Creating a development environment in the cloud would be a highly flexible and agile solution. Developers can spin-up VMs and other resources in seconds without capital outlay or provisioning delays, making development fast and flexible. This also reduces the internal burden on networks and IT, as they no longer need to be involved every time a developer wants to spin up an instance.
        
        ### Part 2: Building Apps Using Containers
        
        - When considering building apps using containers, there are a few key factors to take into account:
        
        #### Skills and Experience
        
        - The development team needs to have the required skills or experience in creating and managing containers. We can only advise on which platform they could use that supports containers.
        
        #### Platform Options
        
        - They have a choice of App Engine Flexible Environment, Compute Engine, or Kubernetes Engine. Each has its place, but if they're serious about containers, Kubernetes is the optimal platform for handling and managing containers at scale.
        
        ## Conclusion
        - Building apps using containers can be a great way to embrace continuous improvement and rapid deployment culture. However, it's essential to consider the development team's skills and experience, as well as choosing the right platform that supports containers.
