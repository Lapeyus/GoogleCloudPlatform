        # App Engine Flexible Environment
        ## Overview
        - Flexible environment allows for more control over application deployment and scaling.
        
        ### Key Features
        
        - **SSH access**: Allows direct access to virtual machines where applications run.
        - **Local disk usage**: Enables use of local disk for scratch base and installation of third-party software.
        - **Network calls**: Allows applications to make network calls without going through App Engine.
        - **Docker containers**: Uses Docker containers instead of a sandbox.
        
        ## Comparison with Kubernetes Engine
        ### Use Cases
        
        - • **App Engine Standard Environment**: For those who want maximum control over application deployment and scaling.
        - • **Kubernetes Engine**: Provides full flexibility of Kubernetes orchestration.
        - • **App Engine Flexible Edition**: Offers a balance between the two, treating containers as a means to an end.
        
        ## API Services
        - **Common use case**: Hosting API services due to quick upload and management of scaling and authentication issues.
        - **APIs**: A common way to open applications up to the outside while maintaining strict limitations.
        
        ## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
        ### Definition
        - A precise description of APIs is necessary for software service implementation, as they can require complex interfaces that change frequently.
        
        ### Challenges
        - Integrating services requires connecting other pieces of software and knowledge of code and internal details.
        - Integration with third parties is difficult due to the need for abstraction and documentation.
        
        ### API Management
        - Google Cloud Platform manages its library of APIs by allowing underlying implementation changes as long as the interface remains working.
        - Developers must version and track their APIs when changes are made.
