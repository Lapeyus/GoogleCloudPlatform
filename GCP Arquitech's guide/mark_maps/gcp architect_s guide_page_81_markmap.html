        # Big Data Processing on Google Cloud Platform
        
        ## Overview
        - Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy, and managed way to run Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Pig on Google Cloud Platform.
        
        ### Benefits of Using Cloud Dataproc
        
        *   No capital investment (CapEx) required
        *   Only pay for hardware resources used during the life of the cluster
        *   Built in 90 seconds or less on top of Compute Engine virtual machines
        *   Scale up or down at will to adjust processing power
        
        ## Features and Capabilities
        
        ### Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and Pig Support
        
        *   Use default configuration or customize for specific needs
        *   Monitor cluster using Stackdriver
        
        ### Cost-Effective Solution
        
        *   No need for major capital hardware investment
        *   Pay only for used resources to reduce operational costs
        
        ### Performance and Reliability
        
        *   Built in 90 seconds or less on top of Compute Engine virtual machines
        *   Scale up or down at will to adjust processing power
        
        ## Alternatives to Cloud Dataproc
        
        *   **Cloud Dataflow**: A fully-managed ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) service that can handle streaming data in real time and/or historical data in batch mode.
        -     *   Serverless architecture with no need for resource provisioning and management
        -     *   Supports expressive SQL, Java, and Python APIs in the Apache Beam SDK
        -     *   Can handle both batch and streaming data with equal reliability
        
        ## Choosing Between Cloud Dataproc and Cloud Dataflow
        
        *   **Use Cloud Dataproc** when:
        -     *   You need to run Hadoop, Spark, Hive, or Pig on Google Cloud Platform.
        -     *   You require a managed service for Big Data processing.
        *   **Use Cloud Dataflow** when:
        -     *   You need to handle streaming data in real time and/or historical data in batch mode.
        -     *   You prefer a serverless architecture with no need for resource provisioning and management.
