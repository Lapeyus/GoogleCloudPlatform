        # Google's Cloud Strategy
        ## Overview
        - Today, Google strives to make their cloud platform attractive, affordable and available to their customers. This change in strategy appears to come about as Google has come to believe like Amazon, that presently and in the future data is and will be integral to all businesses, regardless of size or industry.
        
        ## The Shift from Traditional IT to Data-Driven Business
        - This was not always the case, as even quite recently IT was often considered to be a service function of a business. After all manufacturing or product development, sales, marketing and finance were the core profit generating business units. IT was simply a service department that generated no new money or profit.
        
        - But as technology has become integrated and almost inseparable with all these traditional business functions cloud providers have come to realize that the way a company will differentiate itself from its competitors will be through leveraging cost effective advanced IT technology in order to create new business value from its data. Google's belief is that future companies will largely deal in data, through advanced analytics, Artificial Intelligence and its subset of machine learning.
        
        ## Focus on Data-Driven Businesses
        - Hence, Google's focus is on providing cloud services for businesses that focus on data and analytics, but also for companies that need to reimaging their data centres in the cloud to extend their scale and global reach. As, in the future, companies must have the ability to service customers around the globe.
        
        ## The Need for Global Partnerships
        - Hence, customers that build on-premises solutions will be at a severe disadvantage as the cost are simply prohibitive. What is worse it is crucial capital that is wasted as it should be spent on core business functions that generate profit.
        
        - Thus, Google believes that every company will have a need to rely on data analytics as well as have a global presence and this will require a global partner that can provide them the infrastructure to scale to their ambitions. Ultimately, this strategy will allow them to release their cash and energy to be spent on developing digital processes that permeates the entire organisation and its value and supply chains.
        
        ## Cloud Native Architecture
        - Google's network is designed to support its eight key web-based products which each have in excess of one billion subscribers so it must be designed to be robust, scalable and efficient. But how does it differ from traditional network design?
        
        - At a high level, we can consider cloud-native architecture to mean a design that adapts to take advantage of the many new possibilities-but also the very different set of architectural constraints-offered by the cloud compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
        
        ## Key Considerations for Cloud Native Architecture
        - If we look to some of the high-level elements that you as a network architect will be trained to consider, such as:
        - The functional requirements of a system
        - The non-functional requirements
        - Â· The architectural constraints
