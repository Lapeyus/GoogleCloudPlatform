        # Managed Instance Groups
        ## Overview
        - Managed Instance Groups can work with load balancing services to distribute network traffic to all of the instances in the group.
        - Furthermore, using Managed Instance Groups provides a robust automated system for maintaining service availability.
        
        ## Key Features
        - Automatically restarts if a VM instance in the group should stop, crash, or be accidentally deleted
        - Recreated VM instance uses the same name and instance template as the previous instance
        - Useful for identifying and recreating unhealthy instances in a group
        
        ## Creating Managed Instance Groups
        ### Steps
        - 1. Create an instance template using the console.
        - 2. Use the instance template to create a managed instance group of 'n' specified instances.
        - 3. Define specific rules to apply to the instance group, such as:
        -   - Single or multi zoned?
        -   - Location of instances?
        -   - Ports allowed and load balanced?
        -   - Auto scaling criteria?
        -   - Minimum and maximum number of instances?
        -   - Health check criteria?
        
        ### Rules for Health Check
        - Configurable with complex criteria and thresholds
        - Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL or TLS
        
        ## Regional Managed Instance Groups
        - Can distribute instances across multiple zones in the same region
        - Used to support autoscaling, network load balancing, and HTTPS load balancing
