        ## Homegrown ETL Processing Script
        - For expediency, we didn't want to change languages.
        - However, a better ETL service is available: Dataflow.
        
        ## Resource Deployment
        - After forecast and allocate stages comes deploy. 
        - We have data to drive numbers for forecasts.
        - This makes it easier to get approval.
        - Now, go to the deploy phase and start testing.
        -   - Make testing realistic but easy to run.
        -   - Surface issues before serving users.
        -   - Use unit testing for hard issues.
        
        ## Pricing & Billing
        - Pricing varies between on-premises and cloud initiatives.
        - On-premises pricing is capital expense orientated.
        - Cloud pricing is operational usage with no capital outlay.
        - Examples: bulk-use discounting, discounts for rarely used resources.
