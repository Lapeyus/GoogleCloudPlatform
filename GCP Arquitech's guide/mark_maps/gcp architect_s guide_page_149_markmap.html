        # GCP Pricing Overview
        ## Cloud Compute
        - 1. **Cloud Instance**: Number of nodes in the instance is a billable item.
        - 2. **Storage**: Total amount of storage used is a billable item.
        - 3. **Egress Traffic**: Amount of network bandwidth used by egress traffic is a billable item.
        
        ### Considerations for Forecasting Costs
        
        * Compute cost becomes less important due to comparable performance between SSD and HDD storage types.
        * Choosing the right storage type depends on access patterns (e.g., scans vs. reads).
        
        ## BigQuery
        ### Overview
        - BigQuery is Google's Cloud-based version of a data warehouse, targeting large-scale analytics workloads.
        
        #### Key Features
        
        * **Columnar Data Format**: Faster scanning of large amounts of data.
        * **Serverless Computing**: Seamless scalability without infrastructure management.
        * **Petabyte-Scale**: Supports large datasets and enterprise analytics workloads.
        
        ### Use Cases
        - BigQuery is best suited for:
        
        * Analytical (OLAP) type queries and scanning large amounts of data.
        * Enterprise data warehouse applications.
        
        #### Limitations
        
        * Not designed for transactional (OLTP) type queries or small read/writes.
        * Lacks cross-row transaction support, but supports atomic single-row operations.
        
        ### Pricing
        - BigQuery pricing consists of two major components:
        
        - 1. **Storage Cost**: Based on storage usage.
        - 2. **Query Cost**: Based on query execution time and data size.
