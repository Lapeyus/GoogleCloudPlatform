        - Cluster Federations
        =====================
        
        ### Overview
        
        - Cluster federation is useful when you want to deploy resources across more than one cluster, region, or cloud provider.
        
        #### Benefits
        
        * Enable high availability
        * Offer greater geographic coverage for your app
        * Use more than one cloud provider
        * Combined cloud providers and on-premise solutions
        * Ultra-high scalability
        
        ### Example Use Case
        
        - Consider running environments in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific. Cluster federation will allow you to manage and deploy this in a multi-cloud solution.
        
        #### Integration with Network Load Balancing and Google's Cluster Autoscaler
        
        - Federations also integrate with network load balancing and of course, Google's cluster autoscaler.
        
        ### Container Registry
        
        #### Overview
        
        - Container Registry provides secure, private, docker image storage on GCP.
        
        #### Benefits
        
        * Secure and private image storage
        * Images can be accessed through HTTPS
        * Reliable for consistent uptime and point
        
        #### Example Use Case
        
        - Pull images from any machine, whether that machine is a Google Compute Engine instance or your own hardware.
        
        ### GKE Scalability
        
        #### Overview
        
        - One of Kubernetes Engine's most notable features is its ability to scale from small and medium sized clusters to a truly vast size.
        
        #### Benefits
        
        * Extremely flexible
        * Support single cluster web application just as proficiently as HPA (High Performance Computing) and HTA (High Throughput Computing)
        
        #### Command for Scaling an Application
        
        ```bash
        - kubectl scale [CONTROLLER] my-app --replicas 4
        ```
        
        - Where you would substitute `(Controller)` with the controller type such as deployment or statefullset.
        
        #### Output
        
        - Desired Current Up-to- Available
        - Name     date    Age
        - Test     4       4       4       5min
