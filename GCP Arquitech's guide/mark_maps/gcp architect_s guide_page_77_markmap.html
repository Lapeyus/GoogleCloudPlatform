        # Anthos
        ## Overview
        - Anthos is a collection of complementary services that helps manage containers in either cloud or on-premises environments.
        
        ### Benefits for Developers
        - **Kubernetes Container Management Platform**: Enables developers to deploy containers and microservices based architectures.
        - **Git-compliant Management and CI/CD Workflows**: Provides code for deploying Anthos Configuration Management and code-free protection of services via mTLS and instrumentation using Istio and Stackdriver.
        - **GCP Marketplace Support**: Allows easy deployment of off-the-shelf products into clusters.
        
        ## Operations
        ### Centralized Management
        - **Centralized, Efficient, and Deployment Templates**: Enables single command deployment of new clusters with GKE and GKE On-Prem (gkectl).
        - **Single Pane of Glass Visibility**: Provides centralized configuration management and compliance, simplified deployment, and roll back via Anthos Config Management and Git check-ins.
        - **Stackdriver Integration**: Offers visibility across all clusters from infrastructure through to application performance and topology.
        
        ## Security
        ### Enforcing Security Standards
        - **Cluster Security**: Enforces security standards on clusters, deployed applications, and configuration management.
        - **Centralized Audit Point**: Provides a central point for audit and secured workflow via Git compliant repositories.
        - **Compliance Enforcement**: Uses namespaces and labels to enforce compliance of cluster configurations and secures microservices via Istio and in-cluster mTLS certificates.
        
        ### Anthos Migrate
        - **Automated VM Migration**: Allows easy migration of VMs from on-premises or other clouds directly into containers in GKE.
        - **Infrastructure Management**: Frees operations from managing housekeeping tasks, allowing focus on managing and developing applications.
