        # Cloud Storage
        ## Overview
        - Cloud Storage is designed for storing unstructured data at scale. It provides petabytes and even exabytes of capacity.
        
        ### Classes of Cloud Storage
        - There are four classes of Cloud Storage:
        - **Regional**: Suitable for frequently accessed data.
        - **Multi-region**: Suitable for data that needs to be accessible from multiple regions.
        - **Nearline**: Suitable for less frequently accessed data.
        - **Coldline**: Suitable for archival data.
        
        ## Properties, Characteristics and Usability
        - Cloud storage is perfect for unstructured data because it's simply a big bucket where you can store objects of variable size and type. This makes it the perfect staging point for ingress data into GCP.
        
        ### Storing Data in Cloud Storage
        - Once you've uploaded data to GCP, you'll typically upload it to a cloud storage bucket before sending it to its final destination, such as Cloud SQL.
        
        ## Components of Cloud Storage
        - **Buckets**: Required to have a globally unique name and cannot be nested. Objects within these buckets inherit the storage class of the bucket.
        - **Objects**: Can be text files, doc files, video files, etc. There's no minimum size limit for objects in cloud storage.
        - **Storage Classes**: Can be changed after creation, but some changes are not allowed (e.g., changing a regional bucket to a multi-regional one).
        
        ## Accessing Data in Cloud Storage
        - Data can be accessed using the SDK tool commands in the console or through JSON or XML API's.
        
        ### Limitations of Cloud Storage
        - There's no easy way to index all files like you would in a file system.
        - Creating directories just points to other objects, defeating the purpose.
        
        ## Changing Storage Classes and Moving Objects
        - You can change the default storage class of a bucket but not regional or multi-regional buckets to another type.
        - Regional or multi-regional buckets can be changed to coldline and nearline storage classes.
        - Objects can be moved from one bucket to another using the GCP console, but moving objects between different storage classes requires the gsutil command-line tool.
