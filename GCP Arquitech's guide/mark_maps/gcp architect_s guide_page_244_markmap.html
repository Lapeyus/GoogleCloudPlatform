        # Denial of Service Protection
        ## Overview
        
        - Google provides various denial-of-service (DoS) protection measures to safeguard its network. These measures are not publicly disclosed due to the need for transparency, but they can be utilized by users behind a global load balancer.
        
        ## Built-in Network Protection
        
        - The Google network already offers robust protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks through:
        
        *   Scale
        *   SDN (Software-Defined Networking)
        *   CDN (Content Delivery Network)
        *   Global Load Balancers
        
        - These components work together to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.
        
        ## Additional Measures for VPCs Behind Load Balancers
        
        - To further enhance protection, users can:
        
        *   Filter known bad traffic or specific countries using firewall rules
        *   Block traffic on different ports and protocols
        *   Utilize VM traffic throttling, which limits throughput per VM to approximately 10 Gbps for Ingress
        
        ## Defending Against Infrastructure Attacks
        
        - In the event of a DoS attack that is not detected by network security controls:
        
        *   The infrastructure remains protected by cloud load balancers and auto scaling.
        *   To absorb the attack, users can scale up by adding more resources or split traffic between different regions using a global load balancer.
        
        ## Example: Absorbing Traffic from Different Regions
        
        - If a user is subjected to a DoS attack originating from Asia but is based in the US:
        
        *   They can spin up a region in Asia to absorb the traffic and potentially thwart the attack.
