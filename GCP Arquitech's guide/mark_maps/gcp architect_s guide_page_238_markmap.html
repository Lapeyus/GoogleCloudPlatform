        # Correlated Failures and Overload
        
        ## Correlated Failures
        
        - Correlated failures occur when a single failure causes a chain reaction of events. For example, if a zone or region is lost, all resources in it will fail.
        
        ### Failure Domains
        
        - Identify potential failure domains during the design process to prevent correlated failures. Divide business logic into services based on failure domains, considering entire failure domains rather than individual components.
        
        ### High-Level Perspective
        
        - Look at failure domains from a high-level perspective, such as identifying them at the zone or regional level. This helps separate and isolate risk while designing independent but collaborative services.
        
        ## Failure due to Overload
        
        - When a system is overloaded, it exhibits nonlinear behavior, such as:
        
        * Local applications hanging
        * Disks thrashing
        * Systems stopping responses altogether
        
        ### Common Behaviors of Overload
        
        - Recognize these behaviors when a resource crosses into nonlinear behavior:
        
        * Running out of memory
        * Running out of disk space
        * CPU becoming too high
        
        ### Cascading Failures
        
        - Overloaded resources can lead to cascading failures, making it difficult to troubleshoot. Identify potential points of overload by examining the networking service architecture.
        
        ### Design Process
        
        - Identify important first things that indicate an overload in the design process. This helps prevent unavailability and creates a huge chain of effect, causing dependent services to fail.
