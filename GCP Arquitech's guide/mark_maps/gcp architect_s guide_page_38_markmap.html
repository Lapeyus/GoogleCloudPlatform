        - Another important component of a VPC is it provides the critical 
        - internetworking between resources, such as VMs. It does this in a 
        - global and flexible way to ensure that all your cloud based 
        - resources and services can interact with one another. Thus a popular 
        - way to get started in GCP is through creating a VPC.
        
        - When you start out you can create the PVC inside your first GCP 
        - project, or you can simply choose the default VPC and use that. 
        - Regardless, your VPC provides the networking capabilities and services 
        - to connect your Google Cloud platform resources to each other and to the internet.
        
        - Basic Cloud Networking
        - Google's GCP provides you with the concept of the VPC which to all 
        - intent and purposes resembles your own private network. It also 
        - provides the underlying networking required to connect your cloud 
        - resources to each other and the internet. This networking service is 
        - typically automated and requires no intervention from you.
        
        - However if you like you can do many of the network tasks that you perform 
        - on your on-premises network such as you can segment your networks, use 
        - firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes 
        - to forward traffic to specific destinations. However there is a key 
        - difference between your on-premise networking and Google GCP networks.
        
        - Google's GCP is built upon a Software Defined Network which can be 
        - considered to be one vast layer-2 network with global reach. Thus the 
        - Virtual Private Cloud networks that you define will have global scope. 
        - This means that they can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide and 
        - importantly the subnets can span the zones that make up a region.
        
        - This architecture makes it easy for you to build redundancy into your 
        - design as there will be very low latency between resources in different 
        - zones as they are on the same subnet and communicating at layer-2 much 
        - like they were connected to the same switch. This is perfect for business 
        - continuity as a fallure in one zone can be addressed seamlessly by the 
        - resources in another zone.
        
        - Moreover the SDN architecture makes it easy to define your own network 
        - layout with a global scope as in addition to supporting resources in 
        - different zones on the same subnet, you can dynamically increase the size 
        - of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses 
        - allocated to it without affecting the already configured VMs.
        
        - In this example, your VPC has one network.
