        # Google Cloud Storage
        ## Overview
        - Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is an object file storage system that stores data as arbitrary bytes - blobs - and addresses them with unique keys. This allows for web-friendly interactions and doesn't require provisioning capacity or developing a schema.
        
        ### Key Features
        
        #### **Immutable Objects**
        - Storage objects within a bucket are immutable, meaning they cannot be edited in place. Instead, new versions are created.
        
        #### **Encryption**
        - Data is encrypted on the server side before writing to disk, and encryption is applied by default at rest and when data is in-transit using HTTPS.
        
        ### Use Cases
        - Serving website content
        - Archiving data
        - Disaster recovery
        
        ## Benefits
        - No need to provision capacity or develop a schema
        - High durability and availability
        - Web-friendly with URL-based access
        
        ## Best Practices
        - Choose a location close to your customer base for minimal latency
        - Consider legal restrictions on data storage in certain countries
        
        ### Storage Buckets
        - Create a globally unique name for the bucket
        - Specify a geographic location for storage
        - Choose a default storage class
        
        ### Security
        - Data is encrypted on the server side before writing to disk
        - Encryption is applied by default at rest and when data is in-transit using HTTPS
