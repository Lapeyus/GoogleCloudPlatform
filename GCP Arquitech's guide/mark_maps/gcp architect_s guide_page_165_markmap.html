        # Shared VPC
        ## Overview
        - Shared VPC allows for the creation of a shared VPC that is named the host VPC, which can share its network of private IP subnets and their attached resources with all the associated projects called service projects.
        
        ### Benefits
        - VMs and their application and users can then share the use of the resources in the host VPC, which means that a service project will not even require its own network let alone any dedicated resources.
        
        ## Shared VPC Features
        
        * Allow project admins to create VMs in the shared VPC networks spaces
        * Allow network and security admins to create VPNs and firewall rules that are usable by the service projects in the host VPC network
        * Any security policy applied to the host VPC will automatically be inherited by all the service projects
        
        ## Diagram
        - Figure -16
        
        ### Service Project A
        - VM-A
        
        ### Service Project B
        - VM-B
        
        ### Host Project
        - Shared VPC Network
        - Region-US-east-1
        - Subnet 10.0.1.0/24
        - Internal IP for instance A is 10.0.1.3
        
        ### VPC Routing
        - Region US-west-1
        - Subnet 10.15.2.0/24
        - Internal IP for instance B is 10.15.2.4
        
        ## VPC Network Peering
        - It's useful for organizations with several network administrative domains that want to peer with other organizations.
        
        ### Advantages
        - • Reduced network latency - Public IP networking suffers higher latency than private networking.
        - • Network security - Service owners do not need to have their services exposed to the public internet and deal with its associated risks.
