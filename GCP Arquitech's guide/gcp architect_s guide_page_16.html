        <pre>Google recognizes this concern and provides customers with the ability to run their applications elsewhere should the GCP no longer be the most suitable service provider. For examples of how GCP allows customers to avoid being locked in, Google has designed the GCP services to be compatible with open source products.

For example, if we consider GCP's Cloud Bigtable, which is a massive database, what is important is that it uses the same interface as the open source database Apache HBase, giving customers the benefit of code portability. Another example is GCP's Cloud Dataproc, which offers the same open source Big Data environment Hadoop, as a managed service.

In addition, Google is committed to the open source community and projects, regularly publishing key elements of technology using open source licenses. By doing so, Google participates in creating and supporting open source ecosystems. These open source communities and systems provide customers with options other than Google.

For instance, TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine learning, was originally developed inside Google but is now a robust open source ecosystem. Furthermore, Google is making efforts to integrate open source projects into GCP to provide maximum interoperability.

For example, Kubernetes provides GCP customers with the tools to mix and match microservices running on-premises or even on other clouds. Additionally, there is Google Stackdriver, which is GCP's monitoring and management application, a collection of open source tools that allows customers to monitor workloads across multiple cloud providers, such as Amazon's AWS.

Summary

In this chapter - An Introduction to the Google Cloud Platform, we described the benefits of cloud computing in general and then specifically the GCP. We were introduced to some of the GCP core service offerings, which can be broadly categorized into compute, storage, Big Data, machine learning, networking, security, operations, and tools.

Hence, GCP's services can be leveraged to utilize computing, storage, Big Data, machine learning, and application services and functionality for web, mobile, analytics, and backend solutions. We also demonstrated that GCP is an internet-scale solution with global reach, high availability, and reliability yet it remains cost-effective.

Furthermore, GCP is open source friendly and designed for business continuity and security in mind. In the next chapter, we will take a deeper dive into each of the compute services and storage services, explaining how customers can best use them. Additionally, because Google has seven major cloud services supporting over a billion users, this makes security in the GCP paramount and ensures that the GCP is designed with security in mind.

<li><strong>Cloud Bigtable</strong> uses the same interface as Apache HBase, offering code portability.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Dataproc</strong> provides a managed service for Hadoop, allowing customers to leverage the power of big data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Commitment to Open Source Community</h4>
<p>Google is deeply committed to the open source community and regularly publishes key elements of technology using open source licenses. This participation helps create and support open source ecosystems, providing customers with options beyond Google's services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TensorFlow</strong>, an open source software library for machine learning, was originally developed inside Google but has since become a robust open source ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong> provides GCP customers with tools to mix and match microservices across on-premises, other clouds, or hybrid environments.</li>
<li><strong>Google Stackdriver</strong> is a collection of open source tools that enables customers to monitor workloads across multiple cloud providers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interoperability Efforts</h4>
<p>To provide maximum interoperability, Google is integrating open source projects into its services. This allows customers to seamlessly integrate GCP with other cloud platforms and on-premises environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong> provides the necessary tools for mixing and matching microservices across different environments.</li>
<li><strong>Google Stackdriver</strong> enables customers to monitor workloads across multiple cloud providers, including Amazon's AWS.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In this chapter, we introduced the benefits of cloud computing and specifically highlighted Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We discussed GCP's core service offerings, which cater to various use cases such as computing, storage, Big Data, machine learning, networking, security, operations, and tools. GCP is designed with business continuity and security in mind, making it an attractive option for businesses.</p>
<p>The chapter also emphasized Google's commitment to open source and its efforts to integrate open source projects into GCP. This approach provides customers with flexibility and options beyond traditional cloud services.</p></pre>
