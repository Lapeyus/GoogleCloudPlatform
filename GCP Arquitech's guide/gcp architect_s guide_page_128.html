        <pre><h1>Service Accounts in Google Cloud</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Service accounts are a way to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud resources. They can be used to grant permissions to users or groups.</p>
<h3>Authentication Keys</h3>
<p>There are two types of service account keys:</p>
<h4>GCP-managed keys</h4>
<ul>
<li>Used by Google Cloud platform services, such as App Engine and Compute Engine.</li>
<li>Managed by Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h4>User-managed keys</h4>
<ul>
<li>Created and managed by the user.</li>
<li>Can be used with default or custom service accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Access Scopes vs. IAM Roles</h2>
<p>Access scopes are a legacy method for specifying permissions on instances. They can only be customized for default service accounts, but not for user-created service accounts.</p>
<p>IAM roles, on the other hand, provide more granular permission control and can be assigned to groups or users.</p>
<h3>Default Service Accounts</h3>
<p>Default service accounts support primitive, project, and curated Cloud IAM roles.</p>
<h4>Instance Admin Role</h4>
<ul>
<li>Has permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances, and disks.</li>
<li>Can be used as a starting point for customizing access scopes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assigning IAM Policies</h2>
<p>To assign IAM policies to a service account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a service account with the desired IAM role.</li>
<li>Assign the service account user role to users or groups.</li>
<li>Users who are also service account users can access all services for which the service account has access.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious when granting the service account user role to users or groups.</li>
<li>Use GCP-managed keys for default service accounts and user-managed keys for custom service accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Service accounts provide a secure way to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud resources. By understanding access scopes, IAM roles, and authentication keys, you can effectively manage permissions and ensure the security of your cloud-based applications.</p></pre>

        <pre>If we consider an example where applications A and B contain authenticated identities or service accounts, now let's assume that when both applications want to use a Cloud Storage bucket they will request access from the Google authorization server, and in return, they receive an access token. Application A receives an access token with 'read-only' scope, so it can only read from the Cloud Storage bucket. Application B on the other hand, receives an access token with 'read-write' scope, so it can read and modify data in the Cloud Storage bucket.

These tokens can be short-term privileges so if you want to provide read access for only a limited time, say 24 hours, then you can create a 24 hour access token that your application service would use. Scopes can be further customized when you create an instance using the default service account. These scopes can also be changed after an instance is created by stopping it.

However, access scopes cannot be customized for user-created service accounts, but you can always use the granular Cloud IAM roles instead. This restriction is due to access scopes being the legacy method for specifying permissions on your instance. As before the development of the more advances IAM roles, access scopes were the only available mechanism for granting permissions to the service accounts.

Moreover, another distinction between service accounts is that default service accounts will support primitive, project, and curated, or Cloud IAM roles. While user-created service accounts only use Cloud IAM roles for access. Nonetheless, the roles for service accounts can also be assigned to groups or users as a service account can be looked upon as being a resource.

Thus, like any other resource you can assign IAM policies. To achieve this, you will first create a service account that has been assigned with an IAM role. In this example, we will use a service account with the instance admin role, which has the permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances, and disks.

Then, you treat this service account as you would any other resource and decide who can use it by providing users or groups with the service account user role. This allows those users to act as if they were that services account, to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances, and disks. Users who are also service account users for a service account, can access all of the services for which the service account has access.

Therefore, you need to show some caution when granting the service account user role to a user or group. Now you might wonder how service accounts get authenticated as they obviously can't have passwords hard coded in APIs and when they are working autonomously with zero human interaction there is no way to provide credentials.

After all, users require a username and password to authenticate so for a similar purpose service accounts use keys. Authentication Keys There are two types of service account keys; GCP-managed keys and user-managed keys. GCP-managed keys are used by Google Cloud platform services, such as App Engine and Compute Engine.

        <pre><h3>Service Accounts in Google Cloud Platform</h3>
<p>Service accounts are a way to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. They can be used by applications or services that need to interact with GCP without requiring human intervention.</p>
<h4>Access Tokens and Scopes</h4>
<p>When an application wants to use a GCP resource, such as a Cloud Storage bucket, it requests an access token from the Google authorization server. The access token is then used to authenticate the request. There are two types of access tokens: short-term privileges and long-term credentials.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term privileges can be created for limited time periods, such as 24 hours.</li>
<li>Long-term credentials can be used for extended periods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of the access token determines what actions can be performed on the GCP resource. For example, an application with a 'read-only' scope can only read from the Cloud Storage bucket, while an application with a 'read-write' scope can both read and modify data in the bucket.</p>
<h4>Customizing Scopes</h4>
<p>Scopes can be customized when creating a service account instance using the default service account. However, access scopes cannot be customized for user-created service accounts. Instead, granular Cloud IAM roles can be used to specify permissions.</p>
<h4>Assigning Roles to Service Accounts</h4>
<p>Service accounts can be assigned to groups or users, allowing them to act on behalf of the service account. This is done by assigning the service account user role to a group or user.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default service accounts support primitive, project, and curated Cloud IAM roles.</li>
<li>User-created service accounts only use Cloud IAM roles for access.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authentication Keys</h4>
<p>Service accounts use authentication keys to authenticate with GCP. There are two types of authentication keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GCP-managed keys</strong>: used by Google Cloud platform services such as App Engine and Compute Engine.</li>
<li><strong>User-managed keys</strong>: can be created and managed by users.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, service accounts provide a way for applications or services to authenticate and authorize access to GCP resources without requiring human intervention. By customizing scopes, assigning roles, and using authentication keys, service accounts can be used to manage access to GCP resources effectively.</p></pre>
