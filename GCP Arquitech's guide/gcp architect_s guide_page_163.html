        <pre><h1>Google Cloud Interconnect</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Interconnect is a service that allows you to connect your network directly to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using dedicated connections.</p>
<h3>## Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fastest, most reliable, and lowest latency method for interconnectivity</li>
<li>Suitable for large organizations with high data transfer requirements</li>
<li>Can be used for cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-premises, or on-premises-to-on-premises connectivity</li>
</ul>
<h2>## Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with basic network interconnections</li>
<li>Physical presence of a point of presence in a colocation facility</li>
<li>Own routing equipment to support the following technical requirements:<ul>
<li>Ethernet 10Gbps single-mode fibre</li>
<li>IPv4 link local addressing</li>
<li>LACP for bonding multiple links</li>
<li>EBGP-4 with multihop</li>
<li>802.1q VLANs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>## Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Transferring large amounts of data back and forth with Google Cloud Storage</li>
<li>Data-intensive production networks requiring high data transfer rates for daily backup</li>
<li>High-performance, low-latency, and operationally critical traffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>## Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial setup can take a lot of time and expense</li>
<li>Circuit between your network and Google's network is not encrypted (may require additional encryption)</li>
<li>Currently, the Google Cloud VPN cannot be used in combination with a dedicated connection</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>However to reach Google's external IP addresses you must still go out your existing internet gateway using a separate connection. The choice of Direct Connection is determined by your data capacity requirements and it is delivered over one or more 10 Gigabits per second Ethernet connections. There is a minimum of one connection with a maximum of eight connections. That's a capacity on offer of between 10 and 80 Gigabits per second total per interconnect.

However as the minimum deployment per location is 10 Gigabits per second, and the capacity scales by 10Gbs with each additional connection up to a maximum of 8 connections or 80Gbs this provides a range of capacity to suit most large organisations. If your traffic doesn't require that minimum level of capacity of 10Gbs then you should consider using a Cloud VPN.

From a billing perspective, you will find that the cost of egress traffic from your VPC network to your on-premises network is reduced. This means that having a dedicated connection is generally the least expensive method if you have a high volume of traffic travelling to and from Google's network.

However there is one important caveat and that is the circuit between your network and Google's network is not encrypted. This means that your data will be travelling over a dedicated circuit in plain view so you might need to provide your own encryption such as application level encryption or use your own VPN.

Currently, you aren't able to configure and use the Google Cloud VPN in combination with a dedicated connection, but you are able to configure and use your own VPN solution. Direct connections are the fastest, reliable, lowest latency, and maintenance free method for interconnectivity. But before you commit to a dedicated interconnect you should consider a few other points.

You must be familiar with basic network interconnections as you'll be ordering and configuring circuits. Your network must physically have a point of presence that can meet Google's network in a colocation facility. You must provide your own routing equipment. What happens is you will be required to order and configure circuits facility. In order to do this requires that you host your own on- to bring your network to meet Google's within the colocation premises network devices within the co-location facility as this is the termination point for your network.

The network equipment must support the following technical requirements and support for; Ethernet 10Gbs single-mode fibre, IPv4 link local addressing, LACP for bonding multiple links, EBGP-4 with multihop, and 802.1q VLANS. Deciding on a direct connection is not a trivial task as it can take a lot of time and expense initially setting up the pairing in the co-location facility.

However let us take a look at some practical use cases to see where it can be highly advantageous. If you want to transfer large amounts of data back and forth with Google Cloud Storage, you would also want to invest the time to setup a direct pairing arrangement to enable you to do so efficiently, reliably and cost effectively. An added bonus would be that you could take advantage of the on-site backup of the data.

Another example is if you have a data-intensive production network that requires high data transfer rates for daily backup, you probably would want to take advantage of using Cloud Interconnect. This method would not just simply save on bandwidth connection cost, it would also cut-down data transfer times, and perform far more reliably. In addition it would also free other circuits for high-performance, low-latency, and operationally critical traffic.
