<h2>Scalability and Agility</h2>
<p>The ability to scale up and down as required is very appealing to nearly all teams across the organisation at it eliminates the burden of carrying surplus capacity, as well as provides more agility.</p>
<h2>Visibility and Governance</h2>
<p>Despite existing concerns with governance in the cloud in general, GCP's features and tools can offer even more visibility, and thus provide better governance into the IT ecosystem. Indeed increased visibility saves on the proliferation of storage buckets and unnecessary running instances.</p>
<h2>Cost Effectiveness</h2>
<p>The major cost benefits that a cloud migration could bring a company, particularly start-ups is well understood as it can significantly reduce capital expenditure on hardware but so can virtualisation however it is the operation expenditure that is not so easily understood. Virtualisation does not reduce the operational, maintenance, management and provisioning cost overheads. Cloud environments does significantly reduce these sometimes significantly if you opt for a fully managed service.</p>
<h2>Talent and Innovation</h2>
<p>Google cloud managed services allow IT pros to be less burdened by tedious tasks and housekeeping, which allowed them more time for involvement in projects that produced real business value.</p>
<h2>Modernisation</h2>
<p>The migration of systems and data to the cloud is a major project that gives you the chance to re-evaluate applications and their databases. Perhaps some of these are now legacy or even if they still are mission critical systems they could perhaps be due a modernisation. During any system migration project there will be some systems that will require to be re-architected or re-factored to make them suitable for the cloud.</p>
<h2>Planning the Workload Migration</h2>
<p>The task of moving enterprise data and applications from inside the secure data center outside into the cloud can be particularly daunting. That is why it must be entered into iteratively in manageable steps following a fully prepared migration strategy. The strategy will differ from organisations in other industry but the core steps should be much the same.</p>
<h3>Consider Application Suitability</h3>
<p>Unfortunately not every application is suitable for the cloud and it might require refactoring. It's also important to consider the amount of resources each application uses. The public cloud is a multi-tenant environment, which means applications share resources. And while autoscaling in the public cloud scales resources up or down based on demand, noisy neighbours can be an issue.</p>
<h3>Evaluate Costs</h3>
<p>Evaluate costs and consider the potential impact on operation expenditure. Cloud environments can significantly reduce these sometimes significantly if you opt for a fully managed service.</p></pre>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>burden</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...eliminates the burden of carrying surplus capacity..."</td>
<td>The term "burden" refers to the weight or responsibility associated with managing excess resources, such as spare computing power or storage capacity. In this context, cloud computing eliminates this burden by providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>overprovisioning</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...carrying surplus capacity..."</td>
<td>Overprovisioning refers to the practice of allocating more resources than are actually needed, often to account for uncertainty or potential future growth. In the context of cloud computing, this concept is relevant because it can lead to unnecessary costs and inefficiencies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>agility</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...and provides more agility."</td>
<td>Agility refers to the ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances or demands. In the context of cloud computing, scalability and flexibility enable organizations to respond rapidly to changes in their workload, making them more agile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>visibility</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"Despite existing concerns with governance in the cloud in general, GCP's features and tools can offer even more visibility..."</td>
<td>Visibility refers to the ability to see and understand what is happening within a system or process. In this context, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides enhanced visibility into its IT ecosystem, enabling organizations to better manage their resources and reduce unnecessary costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>governance</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...provide better governance into the IT ecosystem."</td>
<td>Governance refers to the processes and procedures that ensure an organization's systems and data are managed effectively and in accordance with established policies and standards. In this context, GCP provides features and tools that enhance governance capabilities, enabling organizations to better manage their IT resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>storage buckets</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...proliferation of storage buckets..."</td>
<td>Storage buckets refer to containers used to store and organize data in cloud-based systems. The proliferation of storage buckets can lead to unnecessary costs and inefficiencies, as they may not be fully utilized or optimized. In this context, GCP's features and tools help reduce the proliferation of storage buckets, making it easier to manage resources effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>instances</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...unnecessary running instances."</td>
<td>Running instances refer to virtual machines or other computing resources that are actively being used by an application or service. Unnecessary running instances can lead to wasted resources and unnecessary costs. In this context, GCP's features and tools help reduce the number of unnecessary running instances, making it easier to manage resources effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cost effectiveness</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"The major cost benefits that a cloud migration could bring a company..."</td>
<td>Cost effectiveness refers to the ability to achieve significant reductions in costs while maintaining or improving performance and efficiency. In this context, cloud computing can provide substantial cost savings for organizations, particularly start-ups, by reducing capital expenditure on hardware and operational expenditures associated with managing resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>virtual machines</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...reduce capital expenditure on hardware..."</td>
<td>Virtual machines refer to software-based computing environments that can be easily created, managed, and scaled up or down as needed. By using virtual machines, organizations can reduce their reliance on physical hardware, leading to cost savings and improved flexibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>databases</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...re-evaluate applications and their databases."</td>
<td>Databases refer to collections of data that are organized and stored in a way that makes them easily accessible and usable by an application or service. Re-evaluating databases can help organizations optimize their data management practices, improve performance, and reduce costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>legacy systems</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...legacy or even if they still are mission critical systems..."</td>

<td>noisy neighbours</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...noisy neighbours can be an issue."</td>
<td>Noisy neighbours refer to other applications or services that are competing for shared resources in a multi-tenant environment, such as a cloud-based platform. In this context, noisy neighbours can lead to performance issues and decreased efficiency, making it essential to carefully manage resource allocation and prioritization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bandwidth costs</td>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>"...high spikes in demand can also run up bandwidth costs..."</td>
<td>Bandwidth costs refer to the expenses associated with transmitting data over a network or internet connection. In this context, high spikes in demand can lead to increased bandwidth costs, making it essential for organisations to carefully manage their resource allocation and prioritization to avoid unnecessary costs.</td>
