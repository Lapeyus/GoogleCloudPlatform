        <pre>Cluster Federations

Cluster federation is useful when you want to deploy resources across more than one cluster, region, or cloud provider. Cluster federation applies to multi-region cluster containers. You may want to use federations to enable high availability, offer greater geographic coverage for your app, to use more than one cloud provider, combined cloud providers and on-premise solutions, or for ultra-high scalability.

Cluster federation is also helpful when you want resources to be contactable in a consistent manner from both inside and outside your clusters without incurring unnecessary latency or bandwidth costs penalties or being susceptible to individual cluster outages. As an example of how you'd use cluster federation in practice, let's consider that you're going to be running environments in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific, or even through other cloud providers. In this scenario, cluster federation will allow you to manage and deploy this in a multi-cloud solution.

Federations also integrate with network load balancing and of course, Google's cluster autoscaler.

Container Registry

Container Registry provides secure, private, docker image storage on GCP. While Docker provides a central registry to store public images, you may not want your images to be accessible to the world. In this case, you must use a private registry. The Container Registry security features ensure that only authorized users can access and manage your images.

The registry can be accessed through an HTTPS endpoint on GCP, so it can be relied upon for consistent uptime and reliability. This means you can pull images from any machine, whether that machine is a Google Compute Engine instance or your own hardware.

GKE Scalability

One of Kubernetes Engine's most notable features is its ability to scale from small and medium-sized clusters to truly vast sizes. This makes Kubernetes Engine extremely flexible as it can support single-cluster web applications just as proficiently as HPA (High Performance Computing) and HTA (High Throughput Computing) where vast scale is a prerequisite to operations.

The way that Kubernetes handles scaling is important because when we initially deploy our clusters, we can declare how many replicas that we want. We then scale by increasing or reducing the number of clusters as we desire to suit a specific criteria. The fastest way to scale an application is to use the following command: kubectl scale [CONTROLLER] my-app --replicas 4.

Where you would substitute (Controller) with the controller type, such as deployment or statefulset. The output from this command will look something like this:

Desired Current Up-to- Available
Name Date Age Test 4 4 4 4 5min 418

        <pre><h3>Cluster Federations and Container Registry for Scalable Applications</h3>
