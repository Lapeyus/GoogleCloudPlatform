This isn't a particularly good design but it is simple and sufficient for our needs and meets the design specifications for scale. Thus our revised design looks like this:

However, by separating our design, we bring about another design challenge and that is that in doing so, we have split the process of logging across the frontend and the backend. This means processing the logs is more difficult as they are now stored on different servers. Fortunately, they do share a common session ID field, so we need to have a process that will join those logs together for analysis during troubleshooting.

Hence, the new design challenge is to address log aggregation. What we now have to do is have a service that will match the session IDs and stitch them together into a single log file. In this case, we have logs on two different servers, and the goal is to aggregate them into a single log file. Hence, what we need here is a logging server that's sole purpose will be to accept logs using something like a daily cron job that's going to take all these log files and aggregate them.

7.5GB RAM

HDD Storage for Log Files

Consolidated Logs

The way it will do this will be to ingest log files from both sources, then combine them in a single log file. But we also need to transform the file so that all the data is sorted by the unique session ID, so we need to join the log files together based on that session ID.

Fortunately, the logs are simply a Session ID, a Timestamp, and a Payload of maximum 256 bytes. Hence, we want to match on the session IDs on both the web server and apps server logs and then append them together via a simple transform process. The logging service output will then be the aggregated log files we require. Then the cron job will go ahead and run every 24 hours.

        <pre><h3>Revised Design for Log Aggregation</h3>
<p>The original design was simplified to meet scale requirements, but it introduced a new challenge: separating logging across frontend and backend servers.</p>
<h4>Key Components</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP(S)</strong>: PHP, Apache</li>
<li><strong>Region</strong>: US-east-1</li>
<li><strong>Zone</strong>: US-east-1a</li>
<li><strong>Default Network</strong></li>
<li><strong>VM 1</strong>: 2x CPU, 7.5GB RAM (Apache)</li>
<li><strong>DB2</strong>: VM2, 2x CPU, 7.5GB RAM (MtSQL)</li>
<li><strong>MtSQL</strong>: HDD Storage for Log Files</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: Logserver (VM3), 2x CPU, 7.5GB RAM</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design Challenge: Log Aggregation</h4>
<p>The separation of logging across servers makes it difficult to process logs, as they are now stored on different servers. However, the common session ID field allows us to join the logs together for analysis during troubleshooting.</p>
<h4>Solution: Logging Server</h4>
<p>To address this challenge, we need a service that will match session IDs and stitch them together into a single log file. This logging server will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingest log files from both sources</li>
<li>Combine them in a single log file</li>
<li>Transform the data to sort by unique session ID</li>
<li>Join the log files together based on the session ID</li>
</ul>
<p>The logging service output will be the aggregated log files, which will then be processed by a cron job running every 24 hours.</p>
<h4>Revised Design</h4>
<p>| Component | Description |

        <pre><h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the main design challenge introduced by separating the logging process across frontend and backend servers?
Answer: The main design challenge is that processing logs becomes more difficult as they are now stored on different servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do the logs need to be aggregated into a single log file?
Answer: The logs need to be aggregated because they are stored on two different servers, making it difficult to process them together for analysis during troubleshooting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the purpose of the logging server in this design?
Answer: The logging server's sole purpose is to accept logs using a daily cron job and aggregate them into a single log file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does the logging service plan to transform the aggregated log files so that all data is sorted by unique session IDs?
Answer: The logging service plans to join the log files together based on the session ID, which will sort the data accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the expected output of the logging service in this design?
Answer: The logging service's output will be the aggregated log files, which are required for analysis during troubleshooting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do the logs have a maximum payload size of 256 bytes?
Answer: This information is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that the payload size is limited to prevent excessive data from being stored or transmitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you were tasked with implementing this logging design, how would you ensure that the cron job runs successfully every 24 hours?
Answer: You would likely use a scheduling tool like <code>cron</code> on Linux systems or a similar equivalent on other operating systems to schedule the cron job to run daily at a specific time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you handle errors or inconsistencies in the log data during the aggregation process?
Answer: You might implement error handling mechanisms, such as logging errors separately or using a more robust logging system that can handle inconsistencies and errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some potential security considerations when implementing this logging design, especially with regards to storing sensitive session IDs?
Answer: You would need to consider secure storage options for the log files, such as encryption or access controls, to protect sensitive data like session IDs from unauthorized access.</p>
