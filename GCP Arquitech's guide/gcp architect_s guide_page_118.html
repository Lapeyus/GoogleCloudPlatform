<h2>Persistent Disks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HDD</strong>: Suitable for capacity needs only, not high-performance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>SDD</strong>: Offers data redundancy and persistence, suitable for high-performance needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Persistent SDD Disks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide higher performance than HDDs.</li>
<li>Data is distributed across multiple physical disks for redundancy.</li>
<li>Survive VM stop or termination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Local SSDs</h2>

<li>Suitable for applications requiring fast scratch pad storage.</li>
<li>Data survives reset but not VM termination.</li>
<li>Limited to 8 local SSDs with 375 GB each, totaling 3 TB.</li>

<h3>RAM Disks</h3>

<li>Most volatile and require persistent disk backup for data survival.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Considerations</h2>

        <pre>Therefore, these disks are ephemeral but provide very high IOPS offering 680,000 read input/output operations per second that need fast scratch pad storage but if you want to keep the data (IOPS) and 360,000 write IOPS. Local SSDs are suited to applications that require fast performance, but it's essential to copy the data to a persistent drive as it will not survive a VM termination.

Currently, you can attach up to eight local SSD disks with 375 GB each, resulting in a total of three terabytes. However, the data on these disks will survive a reset, but they cannot be reattached to a different VM if terminated.

A similar concept to the local SSD is a RAM disk where you store data in memory. This provides the fastest type of performance available if you only work with small data structures. If that's what your application requires, consider selecting a high-memory virtual machine along with a persistent disk to back up the RAM disk data.

In summary, when it comes to selecting a disk drive, you have several options: persistent disks (HDD or SSD) can be rebooted and snapshotted, while local SSDs and RAM disks are ephemeral and volatile. It's best to stick with a persistent HDD disk if you don't need performance but just need capacity.

Persistent SSD disks offer data redundancy by distributing the data across several physical disks. Local SSDs provide higher performance but without data redundancy or persistence. They survive a reboot but not a VM termination.

RAM disks are the fastest of all, but also the most volatile. Just like local SSDs, there's a limit on how many can be attached to a VM, and persistent HDDs compete with network egress and ingress traffic throughput.

There's a physical limit to the number of persistent drives that can be supported by a VM, depending on the number of CPUs it supports. For example, a VM with 8 CPUs can support up to 128 persistent drives, which is a colossal amount of storage.

It's essential to understand the key differences between physical hard disks and persistent type disks. You'll need to partition hard disk drives for the operating system to get its own share of capacity, but this can be problematic if you want to expand the partition later. Additionally, creating redundant disk arrays or encrypting files before writing them to the disk may be necessary for data redundancy and security.

Finally, persistent SSD disks offer high performance with data redundancy, while local SSDs provide higher performance without it. RAM disks are the fastest but also the most volatile.

        <pre><h3>Disk Drive Options for Virtual Machines</h3>
<p>When it comes to selecting a disk drive for virtual machines (VMs), there are several options available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h4>Persistent Disks</h4>
<p>Persistent disks, whether they are HDD or SSD, can be rebooted and snapshotted, allowing data to survive even a VM deletion. However, if you don't need performance but just need capacity, it's recommended to stick with a persistent HDD disk.</p>
<h4>Local SSDs</h4>
<p>Local SSDs provide high IOPS (input/output operations per second) and are suitable for applications that require fast scratch pad storage. However, the data on these disks will survive a reset but not a VM termination. Currently, up to eight local SSD disks can be attached to a VM, resulting in a total of three terabytes of storage.</p>
<h4>RAM Disks</h4>
<p>RAM disks store data in memory and offer the fastest type of performance available if you only work with small data structures. However, they are ephemeral and volatile, making them unsuitable for applications that require persistence.</p>
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<h3>Key Differences Between Physical Hard Disks and Persistent Type Disks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Partitioning: You'll need to partition hard disk drives for the operating system to get its own share of capacity.</li>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: High-Performance Storage Needs</h3>
<p>High-performance storage solutions like local SSDs and RAM disks are ideal for applications requiring fast scratch pad storage.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Persistent Disk Options</h3>
<p>Persistent disks, including HDD and SDD options, offer data redundancy and can survive even a VM deletion. They are suitable for scenarios where capacity is more important than performance.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Volatile Storage Solutions</h3>
<p>Local SSDs and RAM disks are ephemeral and volatile, making them unsuitable for applications requiring persistent storage. However, they excel in providing fast performance for small data structures.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: Network Interface Limitations</h3>
<p>The number of persistent disks that can be connected to a VM through the network interface is limited by the number of CPUs supported by the VM. This limitation affects both HDD and SDD options.</p>
<h3>Topic 5: Disk Management Considerations</h3>
<p>Key differences between physical hard disk drives and persistent type disks include partitioning, redundancy, and encryption requirements. Proper management of these aspects is crucial to avoid data loss.</p></pre>

<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compare and contrast local SSDs with persistent HDDs. How do their characteristics impact their suitability for different use cases?
Answer: Local SSDs provide high performance but lack data redundancy and persistence, making them suitable for applications that require fast scratch pad storage but not long-term data retention. Persistent HDDs, on the other hand, offer data redundancy and persistence but at a lower performance level.</p>
