        <pre>Ingest
Cloud loT Core is a fully managed service designed to help connect, manage, and ingest data from globally dispersed devices. Easily and securely ingest event streams from anywhere, at any scale, for simple, reliable, real-time stream analytics. Seamlessly move loT data across Google Cloud services. Ingest data with Cloud loT Core and distribute data with Cloud Pub/Sub.

Cloud loT Core, using Cloud Pub/Sub, can combine device data that is widely distributed into a single global system. This single system integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud data analytics services.

There are two main components of Cloud loT Core:
A device manager for registering devices with the service, so you can then monitor and configure them.
Two protocol bridges (MQTT and HTTP) that devices can use to connect to Google Cloud Platform.

Cloud IoT provisioning service is an add-on service for Cloud loT Core that simplifies device creation and monitoring. It allows you to securely add devices to your network by using hardware-based security, enabling you to provision millions of devices to the right Cloud loT Core without human intervention.

Process
This stage involves cleaning and storing data for on-demand solutions that scale.
You apply data extract transform and load (ETL) data with Cloud Dataflow. This is a simplified stream or batch data processing solution using Cloud Functions, which is a serverless solution for developers to create single-purpose independent functions that respond to specified events.

Cloud Bigtable is ideal for storing very large amounts of single-keyed data with very low latency. It supports terrabytes of data and very high read/write throughput, making it ideal for MapReduce type operations. Cloud Storage is used for storing and accessing unstructured data objects on Google Cloud Platform.

Analyse
With the Google cloud loT platform, you can analyse, predict outcomes, and generate insightful actionable intelligence.
The key service modules deployed here are:
BigQuery is a highly scalable enterprise data warehouse that enables you to perform OLAP style queries on large data sets. Cloud Machine Learning (ML) Engine is a managed service, which enables you to build and access machine learning models.

There are several other tools that GCP IoT provides that allow you to focus on data analysis. These integrated tools enable you to generate insights faster by rapidly identifying patterns in the data and surfacing and sharing trends across the business.
For example, there is Cloud Datalab, which is based on open-source Jupyter data notebook. Datalab is an interactive tool used in large-scale data analysis and visualization. IoT data can be explored then combined with other data sources from outside the loT within Cloud Datalab to generate valuable data insights.
