        <pre>Google Data Studio, on the other hand, is used to transform data into dashboards and reports. Cloud Dataprep is used to explore, clean, and prepare structured and unstructured data for analysis. Cloud Dataprep is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to worry about, and it works at any scale.

Further, Cloud Dataprep requires no code and uses powerful algorithms to analyze your data choices to suggest or predict ideal data transformations, which it displays in a ranked list. As it is tightly integrated with Cloud Dataflow, you can process clicks on transformations of structured or unstructured data with just a few premises data center to the Google cloud.

Chapter 27-Cloud Migration

Migration from an on-premises environment might not make sense for everyone and for successful migration, you will really need to get everyone onside. This typically requires an in-depth sales pitch that covers all the business areas such as costs, lack of talent, among other considerations. This means that to address these concerns, you will have to sell them on the benefits behind Google cloud migration, be open and address the challenges, and stress Google cloud's major selling points.

It is unlikely there will be a consistent response to a proposed cloud migration across all the business units. Typically, the business-oriented departments will have a focus in terms of costs where as others may have governance and regulatory compliance as their area of priority. There will also be application developers and traditional support teams that feel a move to the cloud would be both detrimental to operational performance and maintenance efficiency.

However, what most people will not pick up on is that it's more about digital transformation of the business and modernizing the workflows and processes that are the major business drivers. However, modernization of the business is only one of the major drivers behind cloud migration. Hence, you should be aware of the other key business drivers and cloud benefits that will have appeal across the business.
