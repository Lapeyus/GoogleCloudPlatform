        <pre>1. Detach the VM.

2. Test the application to verify that it functions accurately post-migration.

Migrate for Compute Engine (formerly Velostrata) is a cloud migration service provided by Google to assist in a seamless transition of applications and VMs from on-premises to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Some key features of MCE include:

- As an agentless service, there is no impact to the workload.
- No need to have source instances running to migrate them to GCP.
- Access to the application remains unchanged or reconfigured.
- Extensive pre-migration checklists and testing ensure validated instances before moving to GCP.

Many enterprises find MCE valuable due to its speed and scale. It can rapidly migrate single applications, saving potentially hours of time and labor, while scaling to 100s of apps using several migration waves that have stateful workloads running in the cloud within minutes rather than days.

How MCE Works

The typical workflow for deploying MCE is as follows:

1. Validate and perform in-cloud testing on clones so that live applications are unaffected.
2. Build your migration waves - pre-planned migration jobs containing an application and all its dependencies, migrated all at once.
3. Deploy the workloads to GCP.
4. Background data synchronisation and transfer to GCP, resulting in near zero downtime.
5. Detach and verify, with the option to roll back if something goes wrong.

MCE provides automatic and seamless transitions between on-premises and GCP for VMs and physical servers. It also includes a right-sizing analytical tool to provision and deploy optimal cloud instances for cost and performance.

Manually Migrating Databases

Moving databases to the cloud without incurring downtime is a complex task, with several problems to overcome. Physically transporting schema and data into the cloud is one challenge, while keeping databases synchronised during this process is another. The following sections provide suggestions on how to accomplish these tasks.

        <pre><h3>Migrate for Compute Engine (MCE) Overview</h3>
<p>Cloud migration can be complex, especially when moving hundreds of applications and their VMs to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To assist with this process, Google provides a migration service called <strong>Migrate for Compute Engine (formerly Velostrata)</strong>.</p>
<h4>Key Features of MCE</h4>
<ul>
<li>Agentless service: No impact to the workload, no need to run source instances.</li>
<li>Seamless access to applications: No changes or reconfigurations required for apps, VMs, or networks.</li>
<li>Extensive pre-migration checklists and testing to validate instances before migration.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of MCE</h4>
<ul>
<li>Speed and scale: Rapidly migrate single applications in hours, scaling to 100s of apps with multiple migration waves.</li>
<li>Faster app deployment: Apps are live up to 100x faster, with migrations completing up to 10x quicker than traditional strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How MCE Works</h3>
<p>The migration strategy involves the following typical workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validate and perform in-cloud testing on clones</strong>: Ensure live applications are unaffected during testing.</li>
<li><strong>Build your migration waves</strong>: Pre-planned migration jobs containing an application and its dependencies, migrated all at once.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy workloads to GCP</strong>: Workloads are deployed to Google Cloud Platform.</li>
<li><strong>Background data synchronisation and transfer</strong>: Data is synchronized and transferred to GCP in the background, resulting in near-zero downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Detach and verify</strong>: Verify migration success; roll back with no loss of data or project time if issues arise.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatic and seamless transitions between on-premises and GCP for VMs and physical servers.</li>
<li>Right-sizing analytical tool to provision and deploy optimal cloud instances for cost and performance.</li>
