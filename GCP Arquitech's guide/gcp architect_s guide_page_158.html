Interconnecting Networks
There are three general ways to interconnect your on-premises or other cloud provider's network to Google's cloud network. You can connect through an intermediary, which is a network service provider that also offers interconnect services. Or you can use a technology like virtual private networking, also referred to as VPN, to create one or more private and secure tunnels through the public internet and connect that way. Or you can connect via the internet using cloud router.

In this chapter, we will discuss in more detail than before the implementation of cloud VPN, cloud router, cloud interconnect, direct peering, and the Google cloud DNS.

The Google Network
Google Cloud's well-provisioned global SDN network is composed of hundreds of thousands of miles of fibre optic cable and seven destinations across the world, with multiple redundant links. From a submarine cables, it spans a large majority of the most popular networking global perspective. Google's global fibre backbone runs services including HTTPS, TCP, UDP Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, and Cloud DNS.

Networking services support IP addressing for global, private, as well as regional segmentation. The scope of Google's networking services includes Google's Software Network Virtualization, Global Networks, and Granular Subnetworks.

You can control access permissions such as through Resource Manager, network IAM roles for identity and access management. Notably, when you connect to GCP, you are actually connecting as well as firewall rules and bastion hosts for security. However, it is into Google's own global network and the very same infrastructure that YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Drive, and Android development run on.

So, you are in effect inheriting many of Google's own access controls. There are several ways that you can connect and benefit from Google's robust and secure network infrastructure. You can use a VPN or Cloud Router, which will be sufficient for most organizations. However, for large-scale deployments with heavy ingress and egress traffic, you might consider Cloud Interconnect or even connecting through Direct Peering.

Cloud VPN
Google Cloud VPN provides a secure communication channel over the internet, which securely connects your on-premises network to your GCP VPC network through an IPsec VPN connection. Traffic travelling over the VPN between the two networks is protected by the IPsec protocol, which creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the end-points to provide data; confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The IPsec protocol ensures that all packets are encrypted by one VPN gateway at the tunnel ingress and then decrypted by the other VPN gateway at the tunnel egress. This ensures that all your data is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. Importantly, as the VPN is constructed using private IP ranges, this ensures that traffic can only flow between networks when the VPN tunnel is established and secure.

        <pre><h1>Interconnecting Networks with Google Cloud</h1>
<p>To make an informed decision about connecting your infrastructure to Google Cloud, consider the following options:</p>
<h3>Intermediary Network Service Provider</h3>
<p>Connect through a network service provider that offers interconnect services. This option allows you to leverage their expertise and resources.</p>
<h3>Virtual Private Networking (VPN)</h3>
<p>Use VPN technology to create secure tunnels between your on-premises network and GCP VPC network. This provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</p>
<h3>Cloud Router</h3>
<p>Connect via the internet using a cloud router. This is suitable for most organizations but may not be sufficient for large-scale deployments with heavy traffic.</p>
<h3>Additional Options</h3>
<p>Consider the following options to enhance your connection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Interconnect</strong>: Suitable for large-scale deployments with heavy ingress and egress traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Peering</strong>: Provides security and privacy controls.</li>
<li><strong>Google Cloud DNS</strong>: Supports IP addressing for global, private, and regional segmentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Cloud Network</h3>
<p>Google Cloud's well-provisioned global SDN network spans hundreds of thousands of miles of fibre optic cable and seven destinations across the world. The network provides services such as HTTPS, TCP, UDP Load Balancing, Cloud CDN, and Cloud DNS.</p>
<h3>Access Permissions and Security</h3>
<p>When connecting to GCP, you inherit access permissions and security controls, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Manager</li>
<li>Network IAM roles for identity and access management</li>
<li>Firewall rules and bastion hosts for security</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging Google Cloud's robust and secure network infrastructure, you can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.</p></pre>
