        <pre><h1>Networking in GCP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), networking is done differently compared to traditional IP networks. This document aims to explain the basics of networking in GCP.</p>
<h3>Subnets in GCP</h3>
<p>Subnets are used to segment a network into smaller groups, each with its own IP address range. However, unlike traditional IP networks where subnets fit into an address hierarchy, GCP subnets do not have parent IP address ranges assigned to them.</p>
<h2>Communication Between VMs</h2>
<p>When considering two virtual machines (VMs) in the same region but different zones, they can still communicate with each other using the same subnet IP address. This is because the first address in a subnet is reserved for the router address and the last address is reserved for the broadcast address.</p>
<h3>Google Edge Routers</h3>
<p>However, when it comes to communication between VMs across different zones, traffic does not traverse the internet as one might think. Instead, it goes through the Google Edge routers, which have different billing, latency, and security criteria that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<h2>Designing IP Plans in GCP</h2>
<p>Typically, IP plans are designed with sub-networks in a top-down hierarchy. However, in GCP, networks do not have IP ranges, so you simply set up a network and create multiple subnets for different departments or teams.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Sub-Networks</h3>
<p>Sub-networks can provide some rudimentary levels of security and manage resources. However, there are more flexible ways to achieve this using Cloud IAM, labels, tags, and managed instance groups.</p>
<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where you have multiple subnets for different departments or teams in your organization. Each subnet represents a separate network segment with its own IP address range.</p>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Subnet 1 (Sales)</h1>
<p>| Products | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | 4 |
| Banana | 2 |</p>
<h1>Subnet 2 (Finance)</h1>
<p>| Products | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | 5 |
| Banana | 3 |</p>
<h1>Subnet 3 (Marketing)</h1>
<p>| Products | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | 6 |
| Banana | 4 |</p>
<h1>Subnet 4 (Development)</h1>
<p>| Products | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Apple | 7 |
| Banana | 5 |
```</p>
<p>In this example, each subnet represents a separate network segment with its own IP address range. The first address in each subnet is reserved for the router address, and the last address is reserved for the broadcast address.</p>
<p>```markdown</p>
<h1>Subnet 1 (Sales)</h1>
<p>172.168.0.1 - 172.168.0.254</p>
<h1>Subnet 2 (Finance)</h1>
<p>172.168.1.1 - 172.168.1.254</p>
<h1>Subnet 3 (Marketing)</h1>
<p>172.168.2.1 - 172.168.2.254</p>
<h1>Subnet 4 (Development)</h1>
<p>172.168.3.1 - 172.168.3.254
```</p>
<p>In this example, each subnet has its own IP address range, and the first address in each subnet is reserved for the router address.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Networking in GCP is done differently compared to traditional IP networks. Subnets are used to segment a network into smaller groups, but they do not fit into an address hierarchy like traditional IP networks. Google Edge routers play a crucial role in communication between VMs across different zones. Designing IP plans in GCP requires careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of sub-networks and other networking options.</p></pre>

        <pre>However, if we consider the subnet C and its VM-f, they are not in the same network. Thus, VM-f cannot communicate directly even though they are in the same region as VM-d and VM-e. They cannot communicate using their private IP addresses so they must communicate over external IPs. But a notable thing is that this traffic doesn't traverse the internet as you would probably think.

Instead, the traffic between VMs C and D is going through the Google Edge routers, which incidentally have different billing, latency, and security criteria that we need to take into consideration.

The diagram has a region, region 1 with two zones, Zone A, and Zone B. Subnetworks can extend across zones within the same region such as subnet 1. The subnet is simply an IP address range, so you can carve up IP addresses within that range into smaller groups.

Just like in traditional IP networks, the first address in the subnet is reserved for the router address. The last address in the subnet is reserved for the broadcast address. Even though the two virtual machines in this example are across different zones, they will still communicate with each other using the same subnet IP address. Essentially, a single firewall rule will apply to both VMs even though they are in different zones.

Typically, in a data centre, you might design your IP plan to be divided into sub-networks in the traditional way based on a top-down hierarchy. For example, you may have a master network 172.168.0.0 and then segment it into smaller blocks called subnets. These subnets are segregated from one another to minimise broadcast traffic.

You could then deploy a different subnet to each department giving them some rudimentary security from one another. Each of these subnets might then represent different departments such as sales, finance, marketing, or development.

The difference though is that in GCP, networks do not have IP ranges so you just simply set up a network and create multiple subnets for sales, finance, marketing, and development. Because there is no parent IP address range assigned to the network, the sub-networks don't need to fit into an address hierarchy.

While sub-networks can be used to provide some rudimentary levels of security and manage resources, there are other more flexible ways of doing this such as with Cloud IAM, labels, tags, and managed instance groups.

        <pre><p><strong>Subnetting in GCP: Understanding Network Segmentation</strong></p>
<p>In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), subnets play a crucial role in network segmentation. A subnet is an IP address range that can be carved up into smaller groups to provide isolation and security.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subnets can extend across zones within the same region, allowing for communication between virtual machines (VMs) in different zones.</li>
<li>The first address in a subnet is reserved for the router address, while the last address is reserved for the broadcast address.</li>
<li>A single firewall rule applies to both VMs even though they are in different zones.</li>
<li>GCP networks do not have IP ranges, so subnets are created without a parent IP address range.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network Segmentation in GCP</strong></p>
<p>In traditional data centers, IP plans are designed using a top-down hierarchy, with master networks segmented into smaller blocks called subnets. This approach minimizes broadcast traffic and provides rudimentary security between departments.</p>
<p>However, in GCP, this approach is not necessary. Instead, you create multiple subnets for each department, without the need for an IP address range. This allows for more flexibility in network design and management.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Network Management Methods</strong></p>
<p>While sub-networks can provide some levels of security and resource management, other methods are more flexible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Tags</li>
<li>Managed instance groups</li>
</ul>
<p>These alternatives offer more granular control over access and resources, making them suitable for complex network environments.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Routing in GCP</strong></p>
<p>When communicating between VMs in different subnets, traffic does not traverse the internet. Instead, it is routed through Google Edge routers, which have different billing, latency, and security criteria that must be considered.</p></pre>
