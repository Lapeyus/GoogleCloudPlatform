        <pre><h1>Kubernetes Deployment</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Kubernetes provides a way to deploy and manage applications through deployments.</p>
<h3>Containers in Pods</h3>
<p>Typically, you only would place one container per pod, but if you have multiple containers with a hard dependency, you can package them into a single pod, and share networking and storage. The pod provides a unique network IP and the containers inside a pod can communicate with one another using the 'localhost' interface and the ports will remain fixed as they are started and stopped on different nodes.</p>
<h2>Starting a Deployment</h2>
<p>One way to run a container in a pod in Kubernetes is to use the <code>kubectl</code> run command. This starts a deployment of a container running in a pod. A deployment represents a group of replicas of the same pod and keeps your pod running even when nodes they run on fail.</p>
<h3>Exposing a Deployment</h3>
<p>To make them publicly available, you can connect a Load Balancer to your deployment by running the <code>kubectl</code> exposed command. In GKE, the Load Balancer is created as a network Load Balancer and Kubernetes creates a service with a fixed IP for your pods. Any client that hits that IP address will be routed to a pod behind the service.</p>
<h3>Service Groups</h3>
<p>A service group is set of pods, which provides a stable endpoint or fixed IP for them. For example, if you create two sets of pods called front-end and back-end, and you put them behind their own services, back-end pods IP addresses may change over time but the front-end pods are not aware of this, nor do they care, as they simply refer to the back-end service by name rather than by IP addresses.</p>
<h2>Scaling a Deployment</h2>
<p>To scale a deployment, run the <code>kubect!</code> scale command. In this case, three pods are created in your deployment, and they're placed behind the service and they will share one fixed IP.</p>
<h3>Declarative Configuration</h3>
<p>The real strength of Kubernetes comes when you work in a declarative way. Instead of issuing commands, you provide a configuration file that tells Kubernetes what you want your desired state to look like, and Kubernetes figures out how to do it.</p>

        <pre>Typically, you only would place one container per pod, but if you have multiple containers with a hard dependency, you can package them into a single pod, and share networking and storage. The pod provides a unique network IP and the containers inside a pod can communicate with one another using the 'localhost' interface and the ports will remain fixed as they are started and stopped on different nodes.

Starting a Deployment
One way to run a container in a pod in Kubernetes is to use the 'kubectl' run command. This starts a deployment of a container running in a pod. A deployment represents a group of replicas of the same pod and keeps your pod running even when nodes they run on fail. It could represent a component of an application or an entire app. By default, pods in a deployment are only accessible inside your GKE cluster.

Exposing a Deployment
To make them publicly available, you can connect a Load Balancer to your deployment by running the 'kubectl' exposed command. In GKE, the Load Balancer is created as a network Load Balancer and Kubernetes creates a service with a fixed IP for your pods. Any client that hits that IP address will be routed to a pod behind the service. The Kubernetes service defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. It is an abstraction that enables you to separate the deployments - to create and destroy pods, allow them administration.

Service Groups
A service group is a set of pods that provides a stable endpoint or fixed IP for them. For example, if you create two sets of pods called front-end and back-end, and you put them behind their own services, back-end pods IP addresses may change over time but the front-end pods are not aware of this, nor do they care, as they simply refer to the back-end service by name rather than by IP addresses.

Scaling a Deployment
To scale a deployment, run the 'kubect!' scale command. In this case, three pods are created in your deployment, and they're placed behind the service and they will share one fixed IP. So far you have learned to run imperative commands like run, expose and scale. This works well to learn and test Kubernetes step by step. But the real strength of Kubernetes comes when you work in a declarative way. Instead of issuing commands, you provide a configuration file that tells Kubernetes what you want your desired state to look like, and Kubernetes figures out how to do it.

        <pre><h3>Running Containers in Pods with Kubernetes</h3>
<p>Typically, one container is placed per pod, but if multiple containers have a hard dependency, they can be packaged into a single pod, sharing networking and storage. The pod provides a unique network IP, allowing containers within the pod to communicate using the 'localhost' interface, while ports remain fixed regardless of node restarts.</p>
<h3>Starting a Deployment</h3>
<p>To run a container in a pod using Kubernetes, use the <code>kubectl run</code> command, which starts a deployment of a container running in a pod. A deployment represents a group of replicas of the same pod and ensures it remains running even when nodes fail. By default, pods in a deployment are only accessible within your GKE cluster.</p>
<h3>Exposing a Deployment</h3>
<p>To make deployments publicly available, connect a Load Balancer to your deployment using <code>kubectl exposed</code>. In GKE, this creates a network Load Balancer and a service with a fixed IP for your pods. Any client hitting the service's IP address is routed to a pod behind the service. The Kubernetes service defines a logical set of pods and policies for accessing them, providing an abstraction for separating deployments.</p>
<h3>Service Groups</h3>
<p>To address the issue of unstable IP addresses, use service groups â€“ a set of pods providing a stable endpoint or fixed IP. For example, creating two sets of pods (front-end and back-end) behind their own services ensures that front-end pods are not affected by changes in back-end pod IP addresses.</p>
<h3>Scaling a Deployment</h3>
<p>To scale a deployment, run <code>kubect! scale</code>. This creates three pods in the deployment, sharing one fixed IP. While imperative commands like <code>run</code>, <code>expose</code>, and <code>scale</code> work well for learning Kubernetes, its true strength lies in declarative configuration files that define desired states, allowing Kubernetes to figure out how to achieve them.</p></pre>
