        <pre><h1>Monitoring and Logging in Cloud Services</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Monitoring and logging are crucial for ensuring the health and performance of cloud-based applications. In this section, we will explore various methods for monitoring and logging different types of data.</p>
<h3>Timeliness of Data</h3>
<p>To ensure that all incoming data is recorded in real-time, periodic queries can be made to a big table or log data. This approach allows for timely detection of any issues with the data storage logs.</p>
<h2>Monitoring Queue Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Monitoring queue mechanisms in Pub/Sub can help detect issues with the ingress process. If the queue becomes too far behind, it may indicate that cloud functions are not scaling quickly enough to handle the processing. This can be achieved through white box monitoring, where the focus is on determining if any of the logs are out of date.</p>
<h2>Black Box Monitoring</h2>
<p>Black box monitoring involves detecting anomalies in network uptime and data ingestion. By combining this with queue monitoring, potential issues between the two can be identified.</p>
<h2>Solution Architectures</h2>
<p>Google provides solution architectures for various use cases, which can be found on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions">cloud.google.com/solutions</a>. These solutions showcase synergies between services and offer custom tweaks specific to certain verticals.</p>
<h3>Example Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring web logs and app logs</li>
<li>Checking timeliness of data storage logs</li>
<li>Monitoring queue mechanisms in Pub/Sub</li>
<li>Detecting anomalies in network uptime and data ingestion</li>
</ul></pre>

      <div id="txt" class="tab">

        <pre>Say we're not getting the data storage logs, but we are getting web logs and app logs. We also want to be able to monitor for all these different services. To do this, we could check for the timeliness of all this incoming data. Therefore, we would periodically query a big table or query our log data to make sure that it's recorded in real time.

We could also potentially monitor the queue mechanisms in Pub Sub. If the ingress process began to get too far behind, perhaps due to cloud functions not scaling quickly enough to handle the processing, then we could detect this. We could do this as a white box monitoring method, where we'd monitor to determine if any of these logs are out of date. Then our black box would monitor for network uptime, and as we're already monitoring queues and checking for data ingestion, we might discover anomalies between the two.

This is only one single example application, but there are many different solutions available. Google actually publishes solution architectures that cover many diverse use cases. If you go to cloud.google.com/solutions, you'll find a wide range of case studies and solutions designed for many different business and industry vertical markets. You can see a lot of synergies between the two and how they take advantage of services, but there are custom tweaks specific to certain verticals.

Google publishes solution architectures which cover many diverse use cases. So, if you go to cloud.google.com/solutions, you're going to find a wide range of case studies and solutions designed for many different business and industry vertical markets.

        <pre><p>To monitor multiple services, including web logs, app logs, and data storage logs, we can employ a combination of white box and black box monitoring methods. The former involves periodically querying log data to ensure it is recorded in real-time, while the latter focuses on detecting anomalies in queue mechanisms, such as Pub Sub.</p>
<p>By checking the timeliness of incoming data, we can identify potential issues with data storage logs. Additionally, monitoring queue mechanisms can help detect if cloud functions are not scaling quickly enough to handle processing, potentially leading to delays or errors.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Google provides solution architectures that cover various use cases and industries. By leveraging these solutions, businesses can take advantage of synergies between services while making custom tweaks specific to their vertical markets.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>White box monitoring involves querying log data to ensure real-time recording.</li>
<li>Black box monitoring focuses on detecting anomalies in queue mechanisms, such as Pub Sub.</li>
<li>Monitoring queue mechanisms can help identify issues with cloud function scaling and processing.</li>
