VM instances in shared VPC service projects that are using the network SVPC have private internal IP connectivity with any endpoints associated to network A. VM instances associated to network A will have private internal IP connectivity with any endpoints associated to network SVPC regardless of whether they live in the host project or a service project.

You can set up VPC network peering between two shared VPC networks. An instance can have multiple network interfaces, one each in different VPC networks, which is shown here on the diagram that follows:

Figure-19

In the diagram, VM1 has a network interface in both network A and network B. Network B is peered with another network C. VM2 in network C can send traffic across to network B to VM1 because nico is peered with network B, and network B routes are automatically propagated to network C when the two networks are peered.

However, for VM2, to send traffic to network A, which is also on VM1, you'd have to configure policy routing for the nic1 interface. This is because addresses and flows for subnet A and interface nico are not installed in network C, so network C knows nothing about network A's nico so it cannot access network A. Similarly, network A knows nothing about network C as it is not privy to the peering arrangement so does not get the routes forwarded even though it is on the same VM1 as network B.

        <pre><h3>Shared VPC Network Connectivity and Private Google Access</h3>
<p>Shared VPC service projects that use the network SVPC have private internal IP connectivity with any endpoints associated to network A. Similarly, VM instances associated to network A will have private internal IP connectivity with any endpoints associated to network SVPC, regardless of whether they live in the host project or a service project.</p>
<h3>Network Peering</h3>
<p>VPC network peering allows two shared VPC networks to communicate with each other. An instance can have multiple network interfaces, one each in different VPC networks. For example, VM1 has a network interface in both network A and network B.</p>
<p>Network peering enables traffic between the two networks, but there are limitations. Network C, which is peered with network B, cannot access network A without configuring policy routing for the nic1 interface of VM2. This is because addresses and flows for subnet A and interface nico are not installed in network C.</p>
<h3>Private Google Access</h3>
<p>Private Google Access enables virtual machine instances on a subnetwork to reach specific services or projects. In this case, it allows VM instances to access Service Project P 1, VM-1, Project 1, Project 2, and Project -P2.</p>
<p>The following networks are accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network B</li>
<li>Network C</li>
<li>Shared PVC</li>
<li>Hosted PVC P3</li>
<li>Network A</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some limitations. For example, network A cannot access network C without configuring policy routing for the nic1 interface of VM2.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Shared VPC and Network Peering</h3>
<p>Shared VPCs enable private internal IP connectivity between endpoints associated with different networks. Network peering allows instances to have multiple network interfaces in different VPC networks.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Private Google Access</h3>
<p>Private Google Access enables virtual machine instances on a subnetwork to reach specific services, such as Service Project P1 and VM-1.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Network Configuration and Routing</h3>
<p>Network configuration and routing play a crucial role in determining the connectivity between different networks. Policy routing is required for certain configurations, such as when an instance needs to access a network that is not directly connected.</p>
<h3>Topic 4: VPC Network Peering and Traffic Flow</h3>
<p>VPC network peering allows instances to send traffic across different networks. However, some configurations may require additional setup, such as policy routing, to ensure proper traffic flow.</p>
<h3>Topic 5: Service Projects and Shared PVCs</h3>
<p>Service projects and shared PVCs enable private internal IP connectivity between endpoints associated with different networks.</p></pre>
