        <pre>But you can host Domain names in GCP using Google Cloud DNS. This is a managed service for those that don't want to create their own BIND server on another VM.

Another networking feature of GCP is alias IP ranges. Alias IP ranges let you assign a range of internal IP addresses to a machine's primary network interface, sas aliases to a virtual IP address. This is useful if you have multiple services running on a VM and you want to assign each service a different IP address. In essence, you can configure multiple IP addresses representing containers or applications hosted on a VM without having to define a separate network interface. You just draw out the alias IP range from the local subnets primary or secondary CIDR ranges.

Routing Traffic

So far we have covered projects, networks, sub-networks, IP addresses and DNS. Now we need to pull this all together to understand how GCP routes traffic. In GCP each network has its own virtual router that collects and maintains the routes that let instances in the network send traffic directly to each other even across subnets.

The virtual router by default only works in regional dynamic mode whereby it only shares routes within its own region. There is an alternative, global dynamic routing mode whereby the virtual router will share routes it learns with every region. Also, each network has a default route that directs packets for an unknown destination to a default gateway that handles IP addresses that are outside the network.

Although these routes will typically cover most of your needs, you can also create special routes that override them should the need arise. However, just because a VM has a route to a packet destination does not mean that the packet can get there. Routes match packets by destination IP address but no traffic will flow without it matching a firewall rule.

Therefore in addition to a valid route, a firewall rules must also allow the packet. Therefore, the default network has preconfigured firewall rules that allow all instances in the network to talk with each other. But the manually created and custom networks do not have any preconfigured rules you will need to create them yourself.

Firewall Rules

To understand how to make firewall rules we must first understand the routing process. By default, a route is created in the routing table when a network is created, enabling traffic delivery from anywhere. Also, a route is created when the subnet is created. This is what enables VMs on the same subnet to communicate internally.

However, a route in the routing table may apply to one or more instances. A route applies to an instance, if the network and instance tags match. For example, if the network matches and there are no instance tags specified, the route applies to all instances in that network.

Compute Engine then creates individual read-only routing tables for each instance.

        <pre><h3>Google Cloud Networking Overview</h3>
<h4>Managed Services and Features</h4>
<p>Google Cloud (GCP) offers a managed service for DNS, allowing users to host domain names without creating their own BIND server on another VM. Another key feature is alias IP ranges, which enable assigning internal IP addresses to a machine's primary network interface.</p>
<h4>Routing Traffic</h4>
<p>In GCP, each network has its own virtual router that collects and maintains routes for instances within the network. The virtual router operates in regional dynamic mode by default, sharing routes only within its region. An alternative is global dynamic routing mode, which shares routes with every region. Each network also has a default route directing packets to a default gateway for unknown destinations.</p>
<h4>Firewall Rules</h4>
<p>To understand firewall rules, it's essential to grasp the routing process. By default, a route is created in the routing table when a network is created, enabling traffic delivery from anywhere. Additionally, a route is created when a subnet is created, allowing VMs on the same subnet to communicate internally. However, routes may apply to one or more instances based on matching network and instance tags.</p>
<h4>Creating Custom Firewall Rules</h4>
<p>Manually created and custom networks require preconfigured firewall rules, which must be created manually. This involves understanding the routing process and applying firewall rules that allow packets to flow between instances.</p>
<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Cloud DNS</strong>: A managed service for hosting domain names without creating a BIND server on another VM.</li>
<li><strong>Alias IP ranges</strong>: Enable assigning internal IP addresses to a machine's primary network interface, useful for multiple services running on a VM.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual router</strong>: Collects and maintains routes for instances within a network, operating in regional dynamic mode by default.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall rules</strong>: Must be created manually for custom networks, applying to one or more instances based on matching network and instance tags.</li>
