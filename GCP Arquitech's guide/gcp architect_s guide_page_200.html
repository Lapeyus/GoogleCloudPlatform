        <pre><h1>Container Clusters</h1>
<h2>Benefits of Running Google Kubernetes Engine</h2>
<h3>Built-in Resilience</h3>
<p>Deployments provide built-in resilience. For example, if a physical node fails with running pods, all pods become unavailable. However, the deployment has rules stating it must have a minimum of two pods running at all times.</p>
<p>So, if there is only one physical node left running, the deployment controller must move the containers from the unhealthy node-if it can - or spin up new ones onto the remaining node.</p>
<h3>Rolling Updates</h3>
<p>Another built-in administrative feature is rolling updates, which allows you to safely and with zero downtime upgrade systems to a new version. In this scenario, we can consider that a version 1.0 of the application is running on three separate nodes in a deployment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deployment rules determine that at all times there must be three running pods available to service the application. What we can do here is launch a fourth pod onto node three with the new version of the application, 2.0.</p>
<p>Once the pod is operational, the service picks up the pod based on the label and now we have four pods, but we only need three. So, deployment manager will shut down the older pod with version 1.0 on node three.</p>
<p>This process is continued until all three nodes have a pod with the updated version 2.0 of the application.</p>
<h3>Built-in IAM Support</h3>
<p>Another benefit of running Google Kubernetes Engine is the built-in IAM support for controlling access to the containerized environment. Using IAM service, you can set the Kubernetes engine's command and control to the same level of security that you give to an administrator.</p>
<h3>Multi-Zone Container Clusters</h3>
<p>Deployment Manager with IAM gives you central axis control when it comes to managing the rest of the platform objects. You can design container clusters so that they are spread across multiple zones for resiliency.</p>
<p>Resources are replicated in the additional zones, and work is done when you enable multi-zone container clusters. If one zone fails, the others can pick up the slack.</p>
<p>For example, we would want to ensure a design so that any single zone is capable of running the entire application. In the design, node pools are instance groups in the Kubernetes cluster and very similar to a managed instance group.</p>
<p>All of the VMs in a pool are going to be exactly the same. However, Pools can contain different virtual machines in other designs. Pools can also be located in different zones, and Google Kubernetes Engine is node pool-aware via labels.</p>
<p>So, based on the pool specific labels that you designated, Kubernetes engine can manage those accordingly. Consequently, the Kubernetes Engine will replicate all node pools and multi-zone container clusters.</p>
<h3>Multi-Region Considerations</h3>
<p>When running across multi-regions, it is always advisable to check any quotas or limits associated with those specific regions.</p></pre>

        <pre>A Container Cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine
-------------------------------------------------

A container cluster consists of actual virtual machines, compute instances that you can go into your console and see. Deployments provide you with built-in resilience.

For example, if you have a physical node failure that has running pods, all of these pods will become unavailable. However, the deployment will have specific rules stating it must have a minimum of two pods running at all times. So, if there is only one physical node left running, then deployment controller must move the containers from the unhealthy node-if it can - or spin up new ones onto the remaining node.

For instance, in a deployment of nodes A and B, should physical node B fail, the deployment will automatically redeploy pods from node B to node A. Another built-in administrative feature is rolling updates, which allows you to safely and with zero downtime upgrade systems to a new version.

In this scenario, we can consider that a version 1.0 of the application is running on three separate nodes in a deployment. Moreover, the deployment rules determine that at all times there must be three running pods available to service the application. What we can do here is launch a fourth pod onto node three with the new version of the application, 2.0.

Once the pod is operational, the service picks up the pod based on the label and now we have four pods, but we only need three. So, deployment manager will shut down the older pod with version 1.0 on node three. This process is continued until all three nodes have a pod with the updated version 2.0 of the application.

Benefits of Running Google Kubernetes Engine
---------------------------------------------

Another benefit of running Google Kubernetes Engine is the built-in IAM support for controlling access to the containerized environment. Using IAM service, you can set the Kubernetes engine's command and control to the same level of security that you give to an administrator.

Deployment Manager with IAM gives you central axis control when it comes to managing the rest of the platform objects. You can design container clusters so that they are spread across multiple zones for resiliency. Resources are replicated in the additional zones, and work is scheduled across all of them. If one zone fails, the others can pick up the slack.

For example, we would want to ensure a design so that any single zone is capable of running the entire application. In the design, node pools are instance groups in the Kubernetes cluster and very similar to a managed instance group. All of the VMs in a pool are going to be exactly the same. However, Pools can contain different virtual machines in other designs.

Pools can also be located in different zones, and Google Kubernetes Engine is node pool-aware via labels. So, based on the pool specific labels that you designated, Kubernetes engine can manage those accordingly. Consequently, the Kubernetes Engine will replicate all node pools and multi-zone container clusters.

When running across multi-regions, it is always advisable to check any quotas or limits associated with those specific regions.

        <pre><h3>Container Clusters in Google Kubernetes Engine</h3>
<p>A container cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) consists of actual virtual machines, compute instances that can be accessed through the console. Deployments provide built-in resilience by ensuring a minimum number of pods are running at all times.</p>
<p>For example, if a physical node fails with running pods, the deployment will automatically redeploy containers from the unhealthy node or spin up new ones onto the remaining node. This ensures that the application remains available even in case of node failures.</p>
<h3>Rolling Updates</h3>
<p>Rolling updates allow for safe and zero-downtime upgrades to new versions of systems. In a scenario where version 1.0 of an application is running on three separate nodes, launching a fourth pod with the new version (2.0) and allowing it to become operational will trigger the service to pick up the new pod based on its label.</p>
<p>The deployment manager will then shut down the older pod with version 1.0 on node three until all three nodes have a pod with the updated version 2.0 of the application.</p>
<h3>Built-in IAM Support</h3>
<p>GKE provides built-in IAM support for controlling access to the containerized environment, allowing users to set the Kubernetes engine's command and control to the same level of security as an administrator.</p>
<p>Deployment Manager with IAM gives central axis control over managing platform objects, enabling users to design container clusters spread across multiple zones for resiliency. Resources are replicated in additional zones, and work is scheduled across all zones. If one zone fails, the others can pick up the slack.</p>
<h3>Multi-Zone Container Clusters</h3>
<p>Enabling multi-zone container clusters ensures that any single zone is capable of running the entire application. Node pools are instance groups in the Kubernetes cluster, similar to managed instance groups, but can contain different virtual machines and be located in different zones.</p>
<p>GKE is node pool-aware via labels, allowing it to manage node pools accordingly. The engine will replicate all node pools and multi-zone container clusters based on designated pool-specific labels.</p>
<h3>Quotas and Limits</h3>
<p>When running across multiple regions, it's essential to check any quotas or limits associated with those specific regions.</p></pre>
