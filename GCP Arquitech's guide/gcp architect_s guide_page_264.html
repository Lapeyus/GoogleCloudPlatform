<p>The concept behind this is that the applications execute within the containers.

The costs and refactoring times also go down due to the wide acceptance of containers within IT.</p>

<p>Many open source applications will work on the me first technical challenge is going to be in migrating applications AMP stack, which we can readily deploy using a preconfigured image in Cloud Launcher.
Similarly we can do the same with Windows Server instances so deploying applications and services directly into VM instances is straightforward.</p>
<h2>Workflow Migration</h2>
<h3>Prioritizing Machines</h3>
<p>When first planning workflow migration you need to prioritize the machines you want to move.
In order to do this with confidence you will need to understand your application's dependencies.
Then, you need to batch these dependencies within the same migration stage.
For example: If an application depends on multiple VMs, migrate all of those VMs at the same time.</p>
<h3>Points to Consider</h3>
<p>• Move the VM to GCP and once this is done perform validation testing and resolve any issues.
• Migrate the application storage to GCP</p>
<h2>Serverless Application Refactoring</h2>
<p>There is another modern trend towards serverless application refactor but this has similar issues to containerization such as in having to learn new tools and technologies.
However, with serverless refactoring there will be some code modifications required to make the application work.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>In summary, you should be aware that in migration to the cloud most applications and data sets will require at least some refactoring if they are to reap the clouds benefits. However, this should be economically viable with some firm deadlines in place to ensure that most of the refactoring work will have a faster return on the investment.</p>
<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
<p>After determining that you can rely on the VMs in the cloud, schedule downtime to cut over your application to GCP.
This happens in two stages:</p></pre>

There is another modern trend towards serverless application refactor but this has similar issues to containerization such as in having to learn new tools and technologies. However, with serverless refactoring there will be some code modifications required to make the application work. This is because although the serverless platforms support most languages and databases they don't yet support all of them.

In summary, you should be aware that in migration to the cloud most applications and data sets will require at least some refactoring if they are to reap the clouds benefits. However, this should be economically viable with some firm deadlines in place to ensure that most of the refactoring work will have a faster return on the investment.

Technical Issues

Now that we have covered the business and project details regarding on-premises to cloud migration, we will need to address some of the typical technical tasks that we will be expected to achieve. Webservers. Many open source applications will work on the me first technical challenge is going to be in migrating applications AMP stack, which we can readily deploy using a preconfigured image in Cloud Launcher. Similarly we can do the same with Windows Server instances so deploying applications and services directly into VM instances is straightforward. But what about workflows and the database?

Workflow Migration

When first planning workflow migration you need to prioritize the machines you want to move. In order to do this with confidence, you will need to understand your application's dependencies. Then, you need to batch these dependencies within the same migration stage. For example: If an application depends on multiple VMs, migrate all of those VMs at the same time. However if that is not feasible then move the components logically. For example; if an application requires a database and a web server, then you can move the database before the web server.

In order to verify your migration strategy and tactics you could clone an on-premises workload and run it in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This enables you to test the migration process without disrupting production. Nonetheless, the points you must consider when migrating workflows are:

• Move the VM to GCP and once this is done perform validation testing and resolve any issues.
• Migrate the application storage to GCP
• After determining that you can rely on the VMs in the cloud, schedule downtime to cut over your application to GCP. This happens in two stages:

        <pre><h3>Containerization Refactoring vs Serverless Application Refactoring</h3>
<p>When migrating applications to the cloud, refactoring is often necessary to reap its benefits. Two modern techniques are containerization refactoring and serverless application refactoring.</p>
<h4>Containerization Refactoring</h4>
<p>This method involves using a technique called containerization refactoring, where applications are moved into containers with minimal modification. The concept behind this is that applications execute within containers, which also enable developers to insert cloud-native features and improve portability. Costs and refactoring times decrease due to the wide acceptance of containers in IT.</p>
<p>However, serverless platforms require code modifications to make applications work, as they don't yet support all languages and databases.</p>
<h4>Serverless Application Refactoring</h4>
<p>This trend has similar issues to containerization, such as learning new tools and technologies. However, with serverless refactoring, some code modifications are required to make the application work, due to limitations in supported languages and databases.</p>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<p>After covering business and project details regarding on-premises to cloud migration, technical tasks need to be addressed. This includes migrating web servers, workflows, and databases.</p>
<h4>Workflow Migration</h4>
<p>When planning workflow migration, prioritize machines to move based on dependencies. Batch these dependencies within the same migration stage. For example, migrate all VMs at once if possible, or move components logically (e.g., database before web server).</p>
<p>To verify the migration strategy, clone an on-premises workload and run it in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without disrupting production.</p>
<p>Key points to consider when migrating workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the VM to GCP and perform validation testing and resolve issues.</li>
<li>Migrate application storage to GCP.</li>
<li>Schedule downtime to cut over the application to GCP in two stages.</li>
