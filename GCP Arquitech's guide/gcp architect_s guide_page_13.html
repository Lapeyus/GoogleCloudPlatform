        <pre><h1>Sustainable Cloud Networks</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the era of the new green deal and the awakening of public awareness that demands a future based upon sustainable and carbon neutral industry, enterprise data centres have come under the spotlight. It is hardly surprising as computer networks consume vast quantities of energy and produce equal amounts of wasted energy in the form of heat.</p>
<h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
<p>Indeed, the internet is built on physical infrastructure, and all those servers consume vast amounts of energy and produce heat as a by-product that has to be controlled or dissipated. Around the world today data centres consume around two percent of the world's electricity supply; hence there is a responsibility for the major data centre providers to provide sustainable and eco-friendly energy plans.</p>
<h2>Google's Sustainable Efforts</h2>
<p>To this end, Google strives to make their internet-scale data centres run as energy efficiently as possible. As a result of their efforts, Google's data centres were the first cloud providers to achieve ISO 14001 certification, which is the gold standard for improving resource efficiency and reducing waste.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this certification, Google is one of the world's largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy, which means that Google has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2007, and will shortly reach a 100 percent renewable energy sources for its data centres.</p>
<h2>Cloud Efficiency Model</h2>
<p>The most commonly used list of benefits for adopting cloud computing is the one created by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. In their definition, cloud computing is considered to be a model for efficiency in remotely hosting and running I.T. services, which have typically five equally important components.</p>
<h3>First Component: On-Demand and Self-Service Model</h3>
<p>First, Google Cloud Platform provides you with access to online remote computing resources; these are delivered as an on-demand and self-service model. Hence, GCP is ideal for small medium business (SMB), small medium enterprises (SME) or for those matter companies of any size.</p>
<p>This is because all you have to do is to use a simple interface to access all the processing power, storage, and network resources that you require. Importantly though, you can have access to all the infrastructure, services and resources without the need for any of your own infrastructure or in-house skills as access to most GCP managed services requires no human intervention at all.</p>
<h3>Second Component: Global Accessibility</h3>
<p>Second, because GCP resources are distributed around the globe and accessible on the internet, you access these resources over the net from anywhere you have an internet connection. Furthermore, your customers can also access your applications or services from anywhere in the world with low latency and high availability.</p>
<p>As a result, you or your customers don't need to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources. What this means is that you can mirror your IT environments not only across zones but also regions and even continents to ensure business continuity in the case of a local or regional disruption of service. Previously, that would have required vast expense establishing multiple data centres and moreover in keeping them synchronised.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, sustainable cloud networks are essential for reducing energy consumption and promoting eco-friendly practices in the industry. Google's efforts in achieving ISO 14001 certification and its commitment to renewable energy sources serve as a model for other companies to follow. By adopting cloud computing, businesses can benefit from increased efficiency, scalability, and global accessibility while minimizing their environmental footprint.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Sustainable Cloud Networks</h3>
<p>As the world shifts towards a sustainable future, enterprise data centers are under scrutiny for their environmental impact. With computer networks consuming vast amounts of energy and producing heat as a by-product, it's no surprise that data centers have come into focus. Google, in particular, has made significant strides in reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
<h3>Achieving Sustainability</h3>
<p>Google's efforts to make its internet-scale data centers run efficiently have paid off. The company was the first cloud provider to achieve ISO 14001 certification, a gold standard for improving resource efficiency and reducing waste. To achieve this certification, Google is one of the world's largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy, making it 100% carbon neutral since 2007.</p>
<h3>Cloud Efficiency Model</h3>
<p>The US National Institute of Standards and Technology defines cloud computing as a model for efficiency in remotely hosting and running IT services. The five key components include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-demand self-service</strong>: Access to online remote computing resources delivered through an on-demand and self-service model, ideal for small to medium-sized businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Broad network access</strong>: Resources are distributed around the globe and accessible over the internet from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Resource pooling</strong>: Resources are pooled together to provide a multi-tenant environment, allowing multiple customers to share resources and reduce waste.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid elasticity</strong>: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to match changing business needs.</li>
<li><strong>Measured service</strong>: Resources are metered and billed based on actual usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits for Customers</h3>
<p>By adopting cloud computing, businesses can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce their environmental impact by running workloads in a sustainable data center</li>
<li>Increase agility and scalability with on-demand resources</li>
<li>Improve business continuity with global access to applications and services</li>
<li>Simplify IT management with self-service models and reduced infrastructure needs</li>
