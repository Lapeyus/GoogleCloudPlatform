        <pre><h1>Cloud Routing Service</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Administration of static routes in networking is just too slow, tedious and error prone for managing any large network.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Dynamic Routing</h3>
<p>A routing protocol manages the exchange of subnet information dynamically, discovering new subnets and changes to the network topology and then advertising those changes to its routing peer.
This allows for a dynamic solution as you outgrow your VPN interconnect as the burden of updating the static routing becomes just too great.</p>
<h2>Cloud Router Service</h2>
<p>The Cloud Router service is a managed service that provides dynamic routing and advertising of new networks and topology changes through a routing protocol, similar to on a physical router in the on-premises network.
However, the GCP's cloud router is only a virtual router as it is part of Google's SDN (Software Defined network) running the BGP routing protocol.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>When you use the cloud router service, you're peering with Google, exchanging dynamic routing information and BGP is auto-discovering the network topology and exchanging information about any existing or new subnets within your VPC.
This is especially beneficial if you're peering with GCP from multiple locations.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>

        <pre>When you create a HA VPN gateway, GCP automatically chooses two public IP addresses, one for each of its two interfaces. Each IP address is automatically chosen from a unique address pool to support high availability and multiple tunnels on each interface. In addition, you can create multiple HA VPN gateways. Both types of VPN, classic and HA VPN, support dynamic routing using BGP, which we will look at next.

Managing static routing soon becomes untenable after a point, and this is why large networks use routing protocols even within their own networks. A routing protocol manages the exchange of subnet information dynamically, discovering new subnets and changes to the network topology, and then advertising those changes to its routing peer.

Eventually, you may find that you will also require a dynamic solution as you outgrow your VPN interconnect as the burden of updating static routing becomes just too great. Then it might be time you considered the Cloud Routing service.

Administration of static routes in networking is just too slow, tedious, and error-prone for managing any large network. However, if your network will have only limited access to the cloud VPC, static routing is fine. It's when your network admin becomes more holistic and the cloud and on-premises networks merge that you will need dynamic routing using either the HA VPN or Cloud Router.

In order to accommodate this common requirement, Google has delivered the Cloud Router managed service. To explore the concepts around the Cloud Router Service, we need a basic understanding of the issue with static routing and what benefits a dynamic routing protocol brings us. It is those administrative issues that Cloud Router service addresses.

This is because the Cloud Router as its name suggests is basically a virtual router that runs in the cloud. The purpose is to provide the same dynamic routing and advertising of new networks and topology changes through a routing protocol as on a physical router in the on-premises network. However, the GCP's cloud router is only a virtual router as it is part of Google's SDN (Software Defined Network) running the BGP routing protocol.

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows you to dynamically discover and advertise new route changes that might be in your network. However, the advertising of routing information and updates only occurs through neighbors, which are preconfigured peers running the BGP routing protocol.

Thus, when you use the cloud router service, you're peering with Google. This means that you are exchanging dynamic routing information and BGP is auto-discovering the network topology and exchanging information about any existing or new subnets within your VPC. This is especially beneficial if you're peering with GCP from multiple locations.

After all, BGP is the protocol that makes it possible for the largest network of them all to run - the Internet. But BGP is daunting and hugely complex, but thankfully, you don't need to concern yourself about that as Cloud Router is a managed service so GCP does all the heavy lifting for you. Therefore, if you want a simple, hands-free, and dynamic solution to static routing, you can utilize Cloud Router for that purpose.

        <pre><h1><strong>Cloud Routing Service: Simplifying Dynamic Routing</strong></h1>
<p>When creating a HA VPN gateway in GCP, two public IP addresses are automatically chosen for each interface. This ensures high availability and multiple tunnels on each interface. Additionally, both classic and HA VPN types support dynamic routing using BGP.</p>
<p>As networks grow, managing static routes becomes increasingly difficult due to the administrative burden of updating routing information. Large networks often rely on routing protocols to manage subnet information dynamically, discovering new subnets and changes to network topology.</p>
<h2><strong>The Need for Dynamic Routing</strong></h2>
<p>Eventually, as networks expand beyond their initial scope, dynamic routing solutions become necessary. This is where the Cloud Router service comes into play.</p>
<h2><strong>Cloud Router Service: A Managed Solution</strong></h2>
<p>Administration of static routes in networking can be slow, tedious, and error-prone. However, with limited access to cloud VPCs, static routing may suffice. It's only when network administrators adopt a more holistic approach, merging cloud and on-premises networks, that dynamic routing becomes essential.</p>
<p>To address this need, Google has introduced the Cloud Router managed service. This virtual router runs in the cloud, providing dynamic routing and advertising of new networks and topology changes through BGP.</p>
<h2><strong>How it Works</strong></h2>
<p>The Cloud Router service allows you to peer with Google, exchanging dynamic routing information and using BGP to auto-discover network topology and exchange information about existing or new subnets within your VPC. This is particularly beneficial when peering with GCP from multiple locations.</p>
<p>While BGP can be complex, the Cloud Router service takes care of the heavy lifting, providing a simple, hands-free, and dynamic solution to static routing.</p></pre>
