        <pre><h1>Cloud Service Design</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud service design is a critical component of cloud architecture, and this chapter introduces the layered and iterative approach to designing cloud services.</p>
<h3>State</h3>
<p>State refers to the current status of a system or application. In cloud service design, state is essential for understanding the current state of a system and identifying areas for improvement.</p>
<h4>Measurement</h4>
<p>Measurement involves collecting data on the performance and behavior of a system or application. This data can be used to identify trends, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about future development.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Requirements are the needs and expectations of users, stakeholders, and other parties involved in the cloud service design process. These requirements must be understood and addressed throughout the design process to ensure that the final product meets the needs of all parties.</p>
<h2>Cloud Service Design Process</h2>
<p>The cloud service design process is iterative and layered, involving multiple stages and feedback loops. This approach allows designers to refine their designs over time, incorporating new information and insights as they become available.</p>
<h3>App Engine Standard Environment</h3>
<p>If developers do not require Docker containers in their application, the App Engine standard environment may be a better option. In this case, the developer simply deploys their code, and App Engine handles the infrastructure.</p>
<h4>App Engine Flexible Environment</h4>
<p>The App Engine flexible environment is a developer-focused, no-ops compute infrastructure platform that abstracts the underlying infrastructure to some extent in favor of developer friendliness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployability</strong>: App Engine Flex makes it easy to deploy by running Docker containers in VMs.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>: App Engine-Flex handles much of the ops for you, including capturing logs, scaling, versioned upgrades, and traffic splitting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Kubernetes Engine</h4>
<p>If developers are familiar with Docker, containers, configuration, and settings, and want to run containerized workloads, then Kubernetes Engine is a better option. GKE provides more control but also requires an understanding of the underlying infrastructure and container orchestration concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: GKE provides more control over the deployment and management of containerized applications.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: GKE can work across a VPN to manage both on-premises and cloud environments, making it a better choice for organizations already running Kubernetes on premises.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cloud service design is a critical component of cloud architecture, and this chapter introduces the layered and iterative approach to designing cloud services. By understanding the state, measurement, and requirements of a system or application, designers can create effective cloud service designs that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.</p></pre>

        <pre>However, if the developers don't need to use Docker containers in their application, App Engine standard environment might be a better option. In this case, they would simply deploy the code and App Engine will handle the infrastructure for them.

On the other hand, there is also App Engine -Flexible environment which is a developer-focused, no-ops, compute infrastructure platform that abstracts the underlying infrastructure to an extent in favor of developer friendliness.

App Engine Flex does not run on standard run-times but instead it runs Docker containers in VMs, which makes it easy to deploy. Further, App Engine-Flex handles much of the ops for you as it handles things such as capturing logs, scaling, versioned upgrades, and traffic splitting.

Nonetheless, if the developers are familiar with Docker, containers, configuration, and settings, and they do want to run containerized workloads then Kubernetes Engine will be a better option. GKE provides for more control but also requires an understanding of the underlying infrastructure and of container orchestration concepts. Kubernetes Engine is also a better choice if you are already running Kubernetes on premises as it can work across a VPN to manage both on-premises and cloud environments.

This should be sufficient to give the developers a better understanding of the best platform for deploying their containerized applications.

Chapter 21-Cloud Service Design

This chapter will describe the layered and iterative approach to cloud service design and process. In order to better understand the design process, we will undertake an architecture design challenge that is iterative and will expand to address particular issues that will be introduced with each subsequent chapter. By taking this iterative approach to the design, we will encounter issues that force us to take a new perspective, so that over time it will evolve from its humble origins as a prototype into a scalable, reliable, stable, and secure design.

After introducing you to the concept of using a layered model for cloud service design, the chapter discusses the three concepts that are critical to design and to cloud architecture in particular: these are state, measurement, and requirements. It is by using these three key concepts along with our iterative approach that will let you start to design a solution.

Importantly, in the beginning, we do not need to understand the exact process of how our design is going to evolve into a stabilized production environment. Indeed, we accept that we are not going to get it right first time. Thus, we just need to know that applying the three concepts iteratively within the design process will get us there eventually. What we do need to have confidence in is the knowledge that following design thinking principles will lead us to a solution.

        <pre><h3>Choosing the Right Platform for Containerized Applications</h3>
<p>When it comes to deploying containerized applications, developers have several options to consider. The choice of platform depends on their specific needs and expertise.</p>
<h4>App Engine Standard Environment</h4>
<p>If developers don't need to use Docker containers in their application, App Engine standard environment might be a better option. In this case, they can simply deploy their code, and App Engine will handle the infrastructure for them.</p>
<h4>App Engine Flexible Environment</h4>
<p>On the other hand, there is also App Engine -Flexible environment, which is a developer-focused, no-ops compute infrastructure platform that abstracts the underlying infrastructure to some extent in favor of developer friendliness. This platform runs Docker containers in VMs, making it easy to deploy and handle operations such as logging, scaling, versioned upgrades, and traffic splitting.</p>
<h4>Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</h4>
<p>However, if developers are familiar with Docker, containers, configuration, and settings, and want to run containerized workloads, Kubernetes Engine will be a better option. GKE provides more control but also requires an understanding of the underlying infrastructure and container orchestration concepts. It is particularly suitable for developers already running Kubernetes on premises, as it can manage both on-premises and cloud environments across a VPN.</p>
<h4>Choosing the Right Platform</h4>
<p>In summary, the choice of platform depends on the developer's expertise and specific needs. App Engine standard environment is suitable for simple deployments, while App Engine Flexible Environment provides more flexibility and control. Kubernetes Engine is ideal for developers with experience in container orchestration and management.</p>
<h3>Cloud Service Design Process</h3>
<p>This chapter will describe the layered and iterative approach to cloud service design and process. The design process will be iterative, expanding to address particular issues introduced with each subsequent chapter. By taking this iterative approach, we will encounter issues that force us to take a new perspective, leading to an evolving design from its humble origins as a prototype into a scalable, reliable, stable, and secure solution.</p>
<h4>Key Concepts in Cloud Service Design</h4>
<p>The chapter discusses the three critical concepts in cloud service design: state, measurement, and requirements. By applying these concepts iteratively within the design process, we can start designing a solution. It is essential to have confidence in the knowledge that following design thinking principles will lead us to a solution.</p>
<h4>Embracing Iteration and Design Thinking</h4>
<p>Importantly, we do not need to understand the exact process of how our design is going to evolve into a stabilized production environment. We accept that we are not going to get it right first time. What we need to have confidence in is the knowledge that applying the three concepts iteratively within the design process will get us there eventually.</p></pre>
