        <pre>Ingress Allow Rules and Firewall
Ingress allow rules allow specified protocol, ports, and IP addresses to connect in. The firewall prevents instances from receiving connections on non-permitted ports and protocols.

Rules can be restricted to only affect particular sources. Source CIDR ranges can be used to protect from undesired connections coming to an instance either from external networks or from GCP IP set of ranges. In addition, source tags can be used to protect an instance from undesired connections coming from specific VM instances that are tagged with a matching tag.

This enables a VM to receive a connection from an external address and deny another VM from receiving a connection from a VM in the same network. You can control ingress connections from a VM instance by constructing inbound connection conditions using source addresses, protocols, ports, and source tags on instances. However, Source Tags can only be used for VM to VM connections.

Load Balancing
The GCP offers a variety of ways to load balance in-bound (ingress) traffic from sources across the internet. You can use the default Global HTTPS load balancing service to put your Web application behind a single anycast IP address across the entire Internet.

The way that works is simply that you deploy the same public IP (an anycast address) across all the diverse Google points of presence (POP). The way that anycast works is that the address is advertised as the unique address for a service across the global network.

Every region in the global network. The idea being that due to the it is not unique as it is presented, advertised and replicated across vast distances and latency involved a user will always connect to the closest PoP advertising that external IP address.

The other geographically diverse PoP instances of that IP address will serve as automatic failover for redundancy. This is because; the user will always connect to the closest geographical point of presence that the IP address determines, so they will also get the best customer experience and lowest latency.

Moreover, the network will load balance traffic for the application among all your back-end instances in the closest region but if necessary it can reach other backends around the world. Load balancing is tightly integrated with GCP's Content Delivery Network.

This gives you the option to cache many types of content close to your regional customers around the globe. To take advantage of Content Deliver Network all you have to do is set up HTTP(S) Load Balancing and then simply enable Cloud CDN with a single checkbox.

However, you may well be wishing to load balance protocols other than HTTPS. In that case, you can use the regional load balancer for global TCP for traffic on many other optional ports. For UDP traffic or for the SSL Proxy, you will also use the regional load balancer. Finally, to load balance the internal ingress traffic within the VPC for example between tiers of a multi-tier application, you will use the internal load balancer.

<ul>
<li>Rules can be restricted to only affect particular sources.</li>
<li>Source CIDR ranges can be used to protect from undesired connections coming to an instance either from external networks or from GCP IP set of ranges.</li>
<li>In addition, source tags can be used to protect an instance from undesired connections coming from specific VM instances that are tagged with a matching tag.</li>

<li>Load balancing is tightly integrated with GCP's Content Delivery Network (CDN), allowing caching of content close to regional customers around the globe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Regional Load Balancers</h4>
<p>Regional load balancers can be used for global TCP traffic on many other optional ports, including UDP traffic or SSL Proxy. They are also used for internal load balancing within a VPC for multi-tier applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal load balancers allow for load balancing of internal traffic within a VPC.</li>
