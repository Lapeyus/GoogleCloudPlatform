        <pre><h1>Cloud Source Repositories</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>That's what Cloud Source repositories is all about. When you use the Cloud Source Repository the managed service provides Git version control to support your development of any application or service that are running on App Engine, but it can also be used on Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>In addition, Cloud Source Repositories, lets you handle any number of private Git repositories, which allows you the freedom to organize and manage your code as you see fit. Further, the Cloud Source Repository also contains a source viewer so that you can browse and view repository files from within the GCP console.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Environment</h3>
<p>Initially setting up your environment in GCP can entail many steps, such as configuring the compute network and storage resources, as well as keeping track of their configurations.
This is considered an imperative method as you issue direct commands. You can do it all by hand if you want to but if you want to clone your environment, you have to replicate all those commands again.</p>
<h3>Declarative Approach</h3>
<p>A better way is to take a declarative approach and proactively work out the commands you need to set up your environment and then make a template as this is more efficient.
This is good if you already have a strong idea of how you wish the environment to be and later should you want to change your environment, you can readily reconfigure it. However this does mean you have an idea of what the environment should look like but not necessarily know how you want the environment to be configured so it's declarative rather than imperative.</p>
<h2>Deployment Manager</h2>
<p>GCP provides Deployment Manager to let you do just that.
Deployment manager is an Infrastructure Management Service that automates the creation and management of your Google Cloud Platform resources for you based upon a template.</p>
<h3>Creating Templates</h3>
<p>To use deployment manager, you will create a template file using either the YAML markup language or Python that will describe what you want the components of your environment to look like. You don't need to imperatively state the commands just what you want it to finally represent.</p>
<h2>Stackdriver</h2>
<p>There is little doubt that in order to run an application reliably and with any stability you need to have robust monitoring.
Managing is only possible with diligent monitoring of the application as it passes you the information about how the system is working and handling demand and traffic fluctuations and provides early warnings as to potential flaws. It also indicates where potential changes may be required to mitigate issues and then subsequently whether the changes you made are working or not.</p>
<h3>Importance of Monitoring</h3>
<p>Monitoring of an application also lets you respond to issues through informed decisions rather than with guesswork or in blind panic mode.

Initially setting up your environment in GCP can entail many steps, such as configuring the compute network and storage resources, as well as keeping track of their configurations.

You can do it all by hand if you want to, but if you want to clone your environment, you have to replicate all those commands again.

Deployment Manager is an Infrastructure Management Service that automates the creation and management of your Google Cloud Platform resources for you based upon a template. To use deployment manager, you will create a template file using either the YAML markup language or Python that will describe what you want the components of your environment to look like.

You don't need to imperatively state the commands just what you want it to finally represent. Then, you give the template to Deployment Manager which figures out how it can achieve your design and then does the actions needed to create the environment your template describes.

If you need to change your environment, edit your template and then tell Deployment Manager to update the environment to match the change. Here's a tip, you can also store and version control your Deployment Manager templates in Cloud Source Repositories.

Stackdriver is essential for running an application reliably and with any stability. You need robust monitoring to manage your application as it passes you information about how the system is working and handling demand and traffic fluctuations.

Monitoring of an application provides early warnings as to potential flaws, indicates where potential changes may be required to mitigate issues, and subsequently whether the changes you made are working or not. Monitoring also lets you respond to issues through informed decisions rather than with guesswork or in blind panic mode.

        <pre><h3>Cloud Source Repositories, Deployment Manager, and Stackdriver</h3>
<p>Cloud Source Repositories is a managed service that provides Git version control for development on App Engine, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. It allows handling multiple private Git repositories, enabling flexible code organization and management.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Environment in GCP</h3>
<p>Initially setting up an environment in GCP can be time-consuming, involving direct commands to configure compute networks, storage resources, and their configurations. However, a declarative approach using templates is more efficient. Deployment Manager automates the creation and management of Google Cloud Platform resources based on a template.</p>
<h3>Deployment Manager</h3>
<p>Deployment Manager uses YAML or Python markup language to describe the desired environment components. It figures out how to achieve the design and performs the necessary actions to create the environment. Templates can be stored and version-controlled in Cloud Source Repositories.</p>
<h3>Stackdriver Monitoring</h3>
<p>Robust monitoring is crucial for running applications reliably and stably. Stackdriver provides diligent monitoring, passing information about system performance, handling demand fluctuations, and providing early warnings for potential flaws. It enables informed decision-making to respond to issues, rather than relying on guesswork or panic mode.</p>
