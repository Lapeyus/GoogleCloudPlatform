        <pre><h1>5Ys Methodology for Resiliency in Business Logic Layer</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The 5Ys methodology is a framework used to troubleshoot faults and understand what initially caused the failure. We will apply this same method to develop procedures that ensure resiliency when deploying revisions to production.</p>
<h2>Designing for the Future</h2>
<p>We will design our business logic layer not based on forecasting, but on real production traffic. This will enable us to budget and modify our development more accurately.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Our Video Transcription Service</h2>
<p>Our video transcription service initially started as a proof of concept hosted on a single box. It has since evolved into a complex array of specialist microservices and network components with IAM and security.</p>
<h3>Key Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>We changed the product's capabilities to become a production-ready system.</li>
<li>We added more capable and robust logging.</li>
<li>We changed to APIs to take advantage of native Google Cloud Services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Administration and Management Tasks</h2>
<p>Administration and management tasks are crucial for best practices. This includes segregating control plane functions from data plane, automating functions, and removing unnecessary human out-of-bound management.</p>
<h3>Isolation and Automation</h3>
<p>We will create internal VMS from the internet using a bastion host and communicate with them only through SSH connections. We can also deploy private sub-networks to segregate business and user logic from the outside world.</p>
<h2>Incident Response Plan</h2>
<p>We need to build an incident response plan that contains guidelines for dealing with outages, such as understanding the severity of the issue and confirming the problem is still persisting.</p>
<h3>Short-term vs Long-term Solutions</h3>
<p>When remediating problems, we must consider short-term versus long-term solutions. We may choose to immediate mitigate infrequent outages by restarting services rather than doing a code rewrite.</p>
<h2>Post-Mortem Analysis</h2>
<p>Finally, we will perform post-mortem analysis to identify the post-fix, clean it, and escalate it to other support teams.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>By applying the 5Ys methodology, we can develop procedures that ensure resiliency when deploying revisions to production. This includes designing for the future, evolving our video transcription service, administering and managing tasks, building an incident response plan, and performing post-mortem analysis.</p></pre>

        <pre>Remember that 5Ys methodology that we used to work through the issues in our troubleshooting faults to understand what initially caused the failure? Well, we utilize that same method to help us develop procedures that ensure that we have resiliency when we deploy our revision to production. Hence, we're going to implement some of the key things we can use to mitigate weaknesses that surfaced during the post-mortem.

So, now we can design not based on forecasting but for the future based on real production traffic and so we can budget and modify our development more accurately. So, let us see how we can apply this to the way we can update our business logic layer in our video transcription service.

Initially, we started out as a proof of concept as an application hosted on a single box but now it's evolved into a complex array of specialist microservices and network components with IAM and security. Moreover, this all came about as a result of an evolution by changing the product's capabilities to become a production-ready system.

But the product itself hasn't changed as the business logic remains fundamentally the same even though we use different technologies to deliver it. In fact, there were very few changes to the product. Most changes were typically added to provide more capable and robust logging, but we did change to APIs, for example, to take advantage of the native Google Cloud Services.

There are a few practical items remaining that we need to cover. Administration and management tasks as best practices suggest that means segregating the control plane functions from data plane; they should be a one-off process. Ideally, we want to automate and functions and removing any unnecessary human out-of-bound management utilizing the serial console, isolating intervention.

When we contemplate isolation, we create things like internal VMS from the internet by using a bastion host and communicating with them only through a SSH connection. We can also deploy private sub-networks, so segregating the business and user logic from the outside world.

This is the great big book of tried and tested remedies to deal with failures. But finally, we need to sit down and build an incident response fix just about any failure. It will contain all the guidelines for dealing with outages such as: What to do if you get an alert notification? Such as advise on how to understand the severity of the issue.

After all intermittent faults are far more complex to deal with as the how to confirm the problem is still persisting. Testing results are not consistent so neither is the process for diagnosing and how to fix the problem. But of course, when remediating problems, there is always the question: are we going to do short-term versus long-term? Maybe a long-term solution is going to be to update a potential flaw in our code, but then it might be more effective to immediate mitigate the infrequent outage by restarting the service rather than do a code rewrite.

But then that's going to have to define what our deployment process will be like. Finally, we have to perform our post-mortem and identify the post-fix, clean it and escalate it to other support teams.
