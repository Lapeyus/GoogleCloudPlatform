        <pre><h1>App Engine Flexible Environment</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Flexible environment allows for more control over application deployment and scaling.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSH access</strong>: Allows direct access to virtual machines where applications run.</li>
<li><strong>Local disk usage</strong>: Enables use of local disk for scratch base and installation of third-party software.</li>
<li><strong>Network calls</strong>: Allows applications to make network calls without going through App Engine.</li>
<li><strong>Docker containers</strong>: Uses Docker containers instead of a sandbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison with Kubernetes Engine</h2>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>• <strong>App Engine Standard Environment</strong>: For those who want maximum control over application deployment and scaling.
• <strong>Kubernetes Engine</strong>: Provides full flexibility of Kubernetes orchestration.
• <strong>App Engine Flexible Edition</strong>: Offers a balance between the two, treating containers as a means to an end.</p>
<h2>API Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common use case</strong>: Hosting API services due to quick upload and management of scaling and authentication issues.</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong>: A common way to open applications up to the outside while maintaining strict limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A precise description of APIs is necessary for software service implementation, as they can require complex interfaces that change frequently.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating services requires connecting other pieces of software and knowledge of code and internal details.</li>
<li>Integration with third parties is difficult due to the need for abstraction and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>API Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Platform manages its library of APIs by allowing underlying implementation changes as long as the interface remains working.</li>
<li>Developers must version and track their APIs when changes are made.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>Flexible environment lets you SSH into virtual machines on which your application runs, use local disk for scratch base, and install third-party software. It also allows your application to make calls to the network without going through App Engine. On the other hand, the standard environment can save money as billing drops to zero for idle applications, making it attractive in a DevOps environment.

An interesting thing is that in the Flexible Environment, App Engine uses Docker containers instead of a sandbox. This raises questions about how App Engine flexible environment compares to Kubernetes Engine. Here's a quick comparison of use-cases for App Engine with Kubernetes Engine:

• App Engine Standard Environment is for people who want the service to take maximum control of their applications' deployment and scaling.
• Kubernetes Engine gives the application owner the full flexibility of Kubernetes orchestration.
• App Engine flexible edition is somewhere in between, treating containers as a means to an end, but for Kubernetes Engine, containers are the fundamental organizing principle.

App Engine is commonly used to host API services because it can quickly upload applications and manage scaling and authentication issues. APIs are a common way to open an application up to the outside while maintaining strict limitations. All interactions with GCP so far have been via APIs that Google exposes for use.

Application Programming Interfaces, APIs

We've mentioned Application Programming Interfaces, APIs, several times already as a method for connecting to services. Now let's give them a more precise description and definition.

The problem persists in software service implementation is that they require precise interfaces that become complex and frequently changeable. Integrating services requires connecting other pieces of software, which requires knowledge of the code and internal details about how they work. This makes local integration with in-house applications difficult but integrating with third parties nearly impossible.

Nonetheless, integrations with third parties do happen, even with banks, as application developers write software that abstracts away unnecessary internal details to provide templates for necessary parameters. This presents a clean, well-defined interface, which is then documented as an API.

API Management

Now that we know what an API is, let's consider how Google Cloud Platform manages their library of APIs. A feature of the API concept is that the underlying implementation can change as long as the interface remains working. Thus, other pieces of software that use the API don't have to change anything.

However, sometimes you will have to change an API to add or deprecate a feature. In this case, clients or other software that use that API will have to know about the changes. Therefore, developers need to version and track their APIs.

        <pre><h3>Flexible Environment vs Kubernetes Engine: A Comparison</h3>
<p>The Google Cloud Platform's App Engine flexible environment offers a balance between control and flexibility, allowing users to SSH into virtual machines, use local disk for scratch bases, install third-party software, and make network calls without going through App Engine. In contrast, the standard environment can save costs by dropping billing to zero for idle applications.</p>
<h3>Comparison with Kubernetes Engine</h3>
<p>App Engine flexible edition falls somewhere in between App Engine's Standard Environment and Kubernetes Engine. While App Engine takes control of application deployment and scaling, Kubernetes Engine provides full flexibility in orchestration. The key difference lies in how containers are treated: App Engine views them as a means to an end, whereas Kubernetes Engine considers them the fundamental organizing principle.</p>
<h3>API Services and Application Programming Interfaces</h3>
<p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a common way to open applications to the outside while maintaining strict limitations. They provide a clean, well-defined interface for connecting to services. However, integrating with third-party services can be challenging due to internal implementation details. To address this, developers create software that abstracts away these details, providing templates for necessary parameters.</p>
<h3>API Management</h3>
<p>Google Cloud Platform manages its library of APIs by allowing the underlying implementation to change as long as the interface remains working. This enables other software to continue using the API without modification. However, when changes are made, clients and other software must be informed, requiring developers to version and track their APIs.</p>
<h3>Use Cases for App Engine</h3>
<p>App Engine is commonly used to host API services due to its ability to quickly upload applications and manage scaling and authentication issues. This makes it an attractive option for opening applications to the outside while maintaining control over internal implementation details.</p></pre>
