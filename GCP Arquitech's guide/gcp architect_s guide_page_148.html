<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud Firestore's is GCP's next generation NoSQL database but with Cloud Firestore you store data in structures called documents, which contain fields mapping to values. These documents are then stored in collections, which are  containers for your  documents ,  which are used to organize your data  and make it easier to build queries.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Documents support many different  data types, from simple strings and numbers, to complex, nested objects </li>
<li>You can create sub-collections within documents </li>
<li>Build hierarchical data structures that scale as your database grows.</li>
<li>Efficient and flexible query system for targeted document-level retrieval</li>
<li>Add sorting, filtering, and limits to queries for more expressive results</li>
<li>Realtime listeners keep data in sync across client apps</li>
<li>Seamless integration with other Firebase Platform and Google Cloud Platform products</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>• The number of reads, writes, and deletes that you perform.
• The amount of storage that your database uses, including overhead for  metadata and indexes.
• The amount of network bandwidth that you use. 
Storage and  bandwidth usage are calculated in  gigabytes (GIB),  where 1 GiB = 230 bytes. All charges accrue daily. However you  get 1GB of free storage per month and 50,000 document  reads per day as well as 20,000 document writes  and deletes per day . After that quota has been exceeded the price is $0.06 per  read, $0.18 per write and $0.02 per delete. Storage is charged  at $0.18 per Gigabyte per month.</p>

        <pre>Cloud Firestore
Essentially, Cloud Firestore's is GCP's next generation NoSQL database but with Cloud Firestore you store data in structures called documents, which contain fields mapping to values. These documents are then stored in collections, which are containers for your documents, which are used to organize your data and make it easier to build queries. Documents support many different data types, from simple strings and numbers, to complex, nested objects and you can create sub-collections within documents and build hierarchical data structures that scale as your database grows.

Additionally, the way that you make a query in Cloud Firestore is efficient and flexible as you can create queries to retrieve data targeted at the document level. This means you do not need to retrieve the entire collection, or for that matter any nested sub-collections. Furthermore, you can also add sorting, filtering, and limits to your queries to make them more expressive and to paginate the results.

The Cloud Firestore data model supports whatever data structure works best for your app and to keep data in your apps current, without retrieving your entire database each time an update happens, you can also add realtime listeners. This feature also keeps your data in sync across client apps, which makes it popular for mobile apps and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.

Finally, we can consider that Cloud Firestore also offers you the opportunity for seamless integration with other Firebase Platform and Google Cloud Platform products.

Pricing
When you use Cloud Firestore, you are charged for the following:
• The number of reads, writes, and deletes that you perform.
• The amount of storage that your database uses, including overhead for metadata and indexes.
• The amount of network bandwidth that you use. Storage and bandwidth usage are calculated in gigabytes (GIB), where 1 GiB = 230 bytes. All charges accrue daily.

However, you get 1GB of free storage per month and 50,000 document reads per day as well as 20,000 document writes and deletes per day. After that quota has been exceeded, the price is $0.06 per read, $0.18 per write, and $0.02 per delete. Storage is charged at $0.18 per Gigabyte per month.

Bigtable
Google Bigtable is Google's cloud storage solution for high-performance and low latency data access. It is widely used in many Google's core services like Google Search, Google Maps, and Gmail. Big Table, like Cloud Datastore, is designed in NoSQL architecture, but it can still use row-based data format.

Where Big Table comes into its own is in throughput as it can handle data read/write under 10 milliseconds, which means it is perfect for those applications that have frequent and large amounts of data ingestion. Furthermore, unlike Datastore, which is similar in purpose, it is designed to scale to hundreds of petabytes and handle millions of operations per second (IOPS).

What makes Bigtable popular is its compatibility with HBase 1.0 API via extensions as this simplifies any migration from HBase. Bigtable, like Cloud Datastore, has no SQL interface and you can only use the API to use Put/Get/Delete commands on individual rows or run scan operations.

Bigtable can also be readily integrated with other GCP tools, like Cloud Dataflow and Dataproc.
