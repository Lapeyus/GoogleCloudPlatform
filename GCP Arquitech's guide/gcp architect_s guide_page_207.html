Reliability and Availability

Once we have modelled the business logic and designed the underpinning network that connects all our functional components together, we can start thinking about resiliency and capacity planning. For example, it is at this stage that we might contemplate how resilient can the design be made in case of failures? What about the design's ability to scale above forecasted loads? What if this becomes a popular application, how will the design cope?

We have forecast capacity and load and even overprovisioned for optimistic use-cases but are we prepared in case things fail or succeed well beyond expectations? In order to answer that question sufficiently, we need to understand the concepts and realities of business continuity and disaster recovery. This might mean a complete redesign, but that's why we have recovery plans.

Project Design Constraints

In this chapter, we are focusing on cloud service design and process, but that discipline doesn't exist in a vacuum. Indeed, you will have all the other tiresome constraints that every other IT project has to rail against. And as ever, there's going to be a compromise on how much budget you have, versus the best most optimal design that you envisage that meets all of the service objectives that you're trying to achieve.

Despite this, we still need to forecast and plan for load and capacity regardless of what the budget might be. Eventually, though, we will have to face the harsh economic reality and compromise through making design changes and tweaks to bring that price costing down.

        <pre><h3>Understanding Cloud Service Design</h3>
<p>The process of designing a cloud service involves multiple tiers: business logic, storage data layer, security layer, reliability and availability, and project design constraints.</p>
<h4>Business Logic and Storage Data Layer</h4>
<p>The first tier is the business logic, which defines the requirements for the storage data layer. This understanding will determine the type of database to use, such as NoSQL or global relational databases. The storage data layer should be designed in conjunction with the business logic.</p>
<h4>Security Layer</h4>
<p>The fourth and final tier is the security layer, which requires thorough scrutiny before deployment. Security controls and threat surfaces must be considered throughout the design process, including identity and access management (IAM). Bastion hosts, service accounts, access-lists, and firewall rules can be used to bolster vulnerable areas in the design.</p>
<h4>Reliability and Availability</h4>
<p>Once the business logic and storage data layer are designed, the focus shifts to reliability and availability. This involves considering how resilient the design is in case of failures, its ability to scale above forecasted loads, and how it will cope with unexpected popularity.</p>
<h4>Project Design Constraints</h4>
<p>Despite the ideal design, real-world constraints such as budget limitations must be considered. Compromises may need to be made to balance optimal design with economic realities. Forecasts and planning for load and capacity are still necessary, even in the face of budget constraints.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Business logic defines storage data layer requirements</li>
<li>Security controls should be integrated into the design process</li>
<li>Reliability and availability considerations must be addressed</li>
<li>Project design constraints, including budget limitations, must be factored in</li>

        <pre><h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the primary goal of designing a cloud service architecture?
Answer: To ensure the system can meet business objectives while considering various constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the text, what should be done at every stage of the design process?
Answer: Security controls and threat surface should be thoroughly scrutinized and integrated into the design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the importance of understanding business continuity and disaster recovery in cloud service design?
Answer: It helps ensure the system can cope with failures or unexpected growth, potentially requiring a complete redesign.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do you think the author's emphasis on security and threat surface will impact the design process?
Answer: The author's focus on security will likely lead to more thorough and integrated security controls throughout the design process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some potential trade-offs that cloud service designers may face, according to the text?
Answer: Designers must balance budget constraints with the need for optimal design that meets all service objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the author's approach to security differ from a traditional "bolt-on" approach?
Answer: The author advocates for integrating security into the design process from the outset, rather than adding it as an afterthought.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose you are designing a cloud-based e-commerce platform. How would you apply the principles outlined in this text to ensure your system meets business objectives while considering constraints?
Answer: You would need to forecast and plan for load and capacity, integrate security controls throughout the design process, and consider potential trade-offs between budget and optimal design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some potential benefits of using a proof-of-concept approach to cloud service design?
Answer: A proof-of-concept approach allows designers to test their logic, identify vulnerabilities, and refine their design before scaling up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might you apply the concept of business continuity and disaster recovery in your own cloud service design project?
Answer: You would need to consider potential risks, develop a plan for recovery, and ensure that your system can scale to meet changing demands.</p>
