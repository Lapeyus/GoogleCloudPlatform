        <pre><h1>GCP Pricing Overview</h1>
<h2>Cloud Compute</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cloud Instance</strong>: Number of nodes in the instance is a billable item.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Total amount of storage used is a billable item.</li>
<li><strong>Egress Traffic</strong>: Amount of network bandwidth used by egress traffic is a billable item.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Considerations for Forecasting Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compute cost becomes less important due to comparable performance between SSD and HDD storage types.</li>
<li>Choosing the right storage type depends on access patterns (e.g., scans vs. reads).</li>
</ul>
<h2>BigQuery</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>BigQuery is Google's Cloud-based version of a data warehouse, targeting large-scale analytics workloads.</p>
<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Columnar Data Format</strong>: Faster scanning of large amounts of data.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless Computing</strong>: Seamless scalability without infrastructure management.</li>
<li><strong>Petabyte-Scale</strong>: Supports large datasets and enterprise analytics workloads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>BigQuery is best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytical (OLAP) type queries and scanning large amounts of data.</li>
<li>Enterprise data warehouse applications.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not designed for transactional (OLTP) type queries or small read/writes.</li>
<li>Lacks cross-row transaction support, but supports atomic single-row operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>BigQuery pricing consists of two major components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Storage Cost</strong>: Based on storage usage.</li>
<li><strong>Query Cost</strong>: Based on query execution time and data size.</li>
</ol></pre>

        <pre>Unlike other cloud providers, GCP prices the compute and storage separately therefore you will need to consider the following three billable items when calculating the overall cost.

1. The type of Cloud instance, and the number of nodes in the instance.
2. The total amount of storage you use.
3. The amount of network bandwidth used by egress traffic.

The problem here is that although it is good that you are billed only for active instances and you pay only for the storage used, it is not easy to forecast if you have a large datasets. Moreover, the compute cost becomes less important as it is the same no matter if you choose an SSD or an HDD storage type.

For example, the difference in performance between SSD and HDD are not comparable. Although the timing to perform writes is the same for both cases, the timing for reads is about 20 times faster with SSD. Of course, there is a case for going with HDD as scans for HDD lag behind SSD by just 20%. Hence, if you know your access pattern is mostly going to be scans, then HDD option might be a good option as HDD storage is only 15% of the cost of SSD.

BigQuery
BigQuery is Google's Cloud-based version of a data warehouse. Unlike Bigtable, it targets data as a big picture and can run a query against vast volumes of data in a short time. This is because in BigQuery the data is stored in columnar data format so it is much faster in scanning large amounts of data compared with Bigtable.

In addition, BigQuery allows you to scale to petabyte and is targeted at the enterprise data warehouse for analytics market space. BigQuery is serverless, which means it is a fully managed service. Serverless computing also benefits from seamless scalability as computing resource can be spun up on-demand without involving administrators managing any infrastructure.

As a result of this transparent scalability, BigQuery can scan Terabytes of data in seconds and Petabytes of data in minutes. On the other hand with regards data ingestion, BigQuery integrates to load or stream data from/to Google Cloud Storage, or Google Cloud Datastore.

However, we must remember that BigQuery is designed as a data warehouse so it is best for analytical (OLAP) type of query and scanning large amount of data and is not designed for transaction type queries (OLTP). For example, for small read/writes, it takes about 2 seconds while Bigtable takes about 9 milliseconds for the same amount of data. Bigtable is much better off for OLTP type of queries.

Although BigQuery supports atomic single-row operations, it lacks cross-row transaction support.

For pricing, there are two major components in the cost of using BigQuery: Storage Cost and Query Cost.

        <pre><p><strong>Understanding GCP Pricing and BigQuery</strong></p>
<p>GCP prices compute and storage separately, making it essential to consider three billable items when calculating overall costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud instance type and number of nodes</strong>: The type of Cloud instance and the number of nodes in the instance impact costs.</li>
<li><strong>Total storage usage</strong>: Storage costs are billed based on actual usage.</li>
<li><strong>Network bandwidth used by egress traffic</strong>: Egress traffic is charged separately from compute instances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges with Forecasting Costs</strong></p>
<p>Forecasting costs for large datasets can be challenging due to the lack of comparable performance between SSD and HDD storage types. While SSDs offer faster reads, HDDs are more suitable for scans, which may impact overall cost decisions.</p>

<p>BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that targets data as a big picture. It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Columnar data format</strong>: Faster scanning of large amounts of data compared to Bigtable.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless computing</strong>: Fully managed service with seamless scalability, allowing for on-demand resource allocation without administrative involvement.</li>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1</h3>
<p><strong>Compute and Storage Costs</strong>
The importance of considering compute and storage costs when calculating overall GCP costs is highlighted. The three billable items to consider are instance type, number of nodes, storage used, network bandwidth, and the impact of choosing SSD or HDD storage on performance.</p>
<h3>Topic 2</h3>
<p><strong>BigQuery Overview</strong>
BigQuery is described as a cloud-based data warehouse that targets large-scale analytics workloads. Its columnar data format enables fast scanning of vast amounts of data, and it allows for seamless scalability without requiring administrator intervention.</p>
<h3>Topic 3</h3>
<p><strong>BigQuery Limitations and Pricing</strong>
BigQuery's limitations include its design for analytical (OLAP) queries rather than transactional (OLTP) queries. It also lacks cross-row transaction support. The cost of using BigQuery consists of two major components: Storage Cost and Query Cost, with pricing varying based on these factors.</p>
<h3>Topic 4</h3>
<p><strong>Comparison to Bigtable</strong>
Bigtable is compared to BigQuery in terms of performance for small read/writes, where Bigtable outperforms BigQuery. However, BigQuery excels in scanning large amounts of data due to its columnar data format and seamless scalability.</p>
<h3>Topic 5</h3>
<p><strong>Storage Type Impact on Performance</strong>
The choice between SSD and HDD storage has a significant impact on performance, with SSDs offering faster reads but slower writes compared to HDDs. The optimal storage type depends on the access pattern, with HDDs being suitable for scans and SSDs being better suited for general-purpose use.</p>
<h3>Topic 6</h3>
<p><strong>Seamless Scalability</strong>
Serverless computing benefits from seamless scalability, allowing resources to be spun up on-demand without requiring administrator intervention. This transparent scalability enables BigQuery to efficiently handle large-scale analytics workloads.</p></pre>
