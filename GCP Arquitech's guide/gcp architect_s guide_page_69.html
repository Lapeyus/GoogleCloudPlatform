        <pre>What would be required is a single purpose function that could perform all the necessary video transcription and storage tasks. Then you would only need it to be triggered to run automatically whenever a user uploads a new video. And that is exactly what cloud functions lets you do.

Introducing Cloud Functions
The beauty of cloud functions is that you just pay whenever your functions run in 100 millisecond intervals. Also, you don't have to worry about servers or runtime binaries. You just write your code in JavaScript in a Node.js environment that GCP provides and then configure it to be triggered by an event. Cloud functions can trigger on events in cloud storage, Cloud Pub/Sub, or in an HTTP call.

However, you only get billed when your event triggers your function and only then for the duration that it runs. Therefore, you no longer need to be concerned - from a capacity planning perspective - whether it runs once a day, once an hour, or once a millisecond as GCP is responsible for managing and providing the required resources.

The way that you can deploy cloud functions is quite simple. You start by setting up a cloud function and choose which events you wish to act as triggers. For each event type, you declare to the cloud functions that this is the event that they react to. Then comes the difficult part - writing and attaching your application's JavaScript functions to your triggers.

This ensures that should an event of interest trigger your function, it will subsequently be executed. After you have set up your application's functions with corresponding events and suitable triggers, your functions will run whenever the event occurs.

Some applications, especially those based upon microservices architecture, can be implemented entirely in cloud functions, which make it very cost-effective. This makes deploying cloud functions a very efficient and easy-to-deploy application. Specifically when you are seeking to enhance an existing application, which may have variable demand, as it removes the worry about scaling.

<h4>Simplifying Tasks with Serverless Computing</h4>
<p>A single-purpose function can perform all necessary video transcription and storage tasks. This is exactly what cloud functions enable.</p>
<h4>Key Benefits of Cloud Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pay-per-use model: billed only when the function runs in 100 millisecond intervals.</li>
<li>No server or runtime binary management required.</li>
<li>Write code in JavaScript using a Node.js environment provided by GCP.</li>
<li>Configure triggers for events in cloud storage, Pub/Sub, or HTTP calls.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How Cloud Functions Work</h4>
<ol>
<li>Set up a cloud function and choose event triggers.</li>
<li>Declare the event types that trigger the function.</li>
<li>Write and attach JavaScript functions to the triggers.</li>
<li>The function will run automatically when an event occurs.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cost-Effective Deployment</h4>
<p>Cloud functions are ideal for applications based on microservices architecture, making them cost-effective and easy to deploy. This approach removes worries about scaling, especially when enhancing existing applications with variable demand.</p></pre>
