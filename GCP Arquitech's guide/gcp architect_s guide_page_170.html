        <pre><h1>Load Balancing in GCP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Load balancing in GCP is a managed service and software-defined, making it easy to configure. It provides geo-location features by capturing requests at locations closest to requestors.</p>
<h3>Anycast Method</h3>
<p>Anycast uses the same public IP address on replicated load balancers across all regions. This ensures requests are routed to the closest load balancer based on the requester's region, providing high availability and redirecting to the next closest service if unavailable.</p>
<h4>Regional Load Balancing</h4>
<p>Regional load balancing distributes traffic across backend servers using TCO and UDP protocols and ports. It can be configured to send HTTP traffic to a pool of web servers with overflow capacity.</p>
<h3>Benefits and Complexity</h3>
<p>While less flexible than hardware load balancers, GCP's load balancing is easy to configure using the console. However, it comes with additional configuration complexity.</p>
<h2>Managed Instance Groups</h2>
<p>Managed Instance Groups provide administrative benefits by allowing simultaneous creation of VMs using an instance template. The template can hold specific common properties for each instance, making it easier to update and scale instances.</p>
<h3>Rolling Updates</h3>
<p>The instance group updater feature enables deploying staggered releases with zero downtime, making it useful for canary updates and rollbacks.</p>
<h4>Scaling Compute Resources</h4>
<p>Managed Instance Groups can use edited templates to scale the number of instances in a group, providing additional compute resources when needed.</p>
<h2>Types of Load Balancing</h2>
<p>There are five types of load balancing covered in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy</strong>: Global services</li>
<li><strong>Network and Internal Load Balancing</strong>: Regional services</li>
</ol>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>This chapter will discuss each type of load balancing in more detail, including their benefits and configuration options using GCP.</p></pre>

        <pre>Load balancing in GCP, on the other hand, is a managed service and is software defined and although less flexible than a hardware load balancer it is easy to configure. For example, Global load balancing in GCP performs the same geo-location feature not by URL and HTTP header analysis but by capturing the request at a location closest to the requestor. It can do this by using Anycast - a method of using the same public IP address on replicated load balancers across all the regions. This means the requestor will always connect to the closest load balancer typically with their region. It also provides for high availability for should that be unavailable they will be redirected - without any human intervention - to the next closest service.

On the other hand, GCP regional load balancing can be configured to distribute traffic across an array of backend servers based on the TCO and UDP protocols and ports. So for example, a regional load balancer will send HTTP traffic to a pool of web servers with some of the servers in the pool acting as overflow capacity to others.

This kind of flexibility and behavior comes with some additional configuration complexity, but this can all be easily configured using the GCP console.

In this chapter, we will also cover managed instance groups and different types of load balancing that you can configure using GCP. We've already discussed how to configure networking between different virtual machines. Further, we have discussed the concept of horizontal scaling where we can replicate a VM to provide additional capacity to scale to match a growing demand.

But how are we going to route incoming traffic between multiple virtual machines on different IPs that are offering the same service? This is where the concept of load balancing comes into play. There are five types of load balancing covered in this chapter, including HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy load balancing, which are global services, whereas network and internal load balancing are regional.

Managed Instance Groups provide several administrative benefits. They allow you a method to create several VMs simultaneously using an instance template, which define the properties for every VM instance in the group. The VMs do not need to be identical in their properties as the template can be made to hold the specific common properties for each instance. Therefore, you can initially configure your environment using a template. Then just as easily update all of the instances' properties within the Managed Instance Group by specifying new parameters for each instance with an edited template in a rolling update.

The instance group updater feature provides you with a method for deploying staggered releases with zero downtime; this makes it useful in applying canary updates with rollback. It is also useful when your applications require additional compute resources as Managed Instance Groups can then use the edited template to scale the number of instances in the group.

<h2>Global Load Balancing</h2>
<p>GCP's global load balancing performs geo-location-based routing by capturing requests at locations closest to the requestor. This is achieved through Anycast, a method of using the same public IP address on replicated load balancers across all regions. The requestor will always connect to the closest load balancer typically with their region.</p>
