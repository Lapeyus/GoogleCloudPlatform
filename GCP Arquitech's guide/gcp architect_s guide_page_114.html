        <pre><h1>Machine Types Overview</h1>
<h2>High Memory Machine Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ideal for applications with high memory requirements relative to virtual CPUs.</li>
<li>Start at 6.5 GB of RAM per VCPU, nearly doubling the amount compared to standard types.</li>
</ul>
<h2>High CPU Machine Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for applications demanding more virtual CPUs relative to memory.</li>
<li>Start at 0.9 GB of RAM per VCPU.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Predefined vs Custom Machine Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>Predefined machine types are constantly being evaluated and may change or become unavailable in certain regions.</li>
<li>Check the Web Console for availability in your region.</li>
<li>If predefined types don't meet compute needs, create a custom machine type to customize CPU, memory, and GPU requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specialist Machine Types for HPC and ML</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google provides Compute Optimized (C2) and Memory Optimized (M2) VMs to meet the requirements of High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning (ML) workloads.</li>
<li>C2 VMs offer high per-thread performance, increased memory speeds, and improved performance for HPC and gaming applications.</li>
<li>M2 VMs provide the highest memory configuration, suitable for memory-intensive workloads like large in-memory databases and data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom Machine Type Discounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Custom machines don't fit into a category, making them ineligible for Google's standard machine type discount plan.</li>
<li>Compute Engine calculates virtual CPU and memory usage to apply discounts based on sustained user rates.</li>
</ul></pre>

        <pre>In contrast, high memory machine types are best suited for applications that require more memory relative to the number of virtual CPUs. These machine types start out at 6.5 gigabytes of RAM per virtual CPU, nearly double the amount of ram per VCPU as the standard type.

On the other hand, high CPU machine types are best suited for applications that are processor intensive and demand more virtual CPUs relative to memory. These machine types start out at 0.9 gigabytes of RAM per virtual CPU.

Now, these options are constantly being evaluated, and some configurations aren't available in all regions. So, you need to check the Web Console if the preconfigured type is available in your region.

If the predefined machine types don't fit your compute needs, you can always create a custom machine type where you can customize your CPU memory and GPU needs. In most cases, these general VM machine-types will suffice for your workloads. However, as more users deploy in the cloud to use HPC (High Performance Computing) and ML (Machine Learning) infrastructures, Google provides specialist machine types and CPUs to meet those requirements.

The Compute Optimized and Memory Optimized CPUs meet the requirements of HPC and ML as they are able to provide specific compute or memory requirements that match your large workloads.

Compute Optimized VMs (C2) expose high per-thread performance for compute-intensive workloads. They offer increased memory speeds that suit the requirements of most for HPC and gaming, but are equally proficient serving single thread applications. The new Compute-Optimized VMs offer a greater than 40% performance improvement compared to current GCP VMs.

On the other hand, Memory Optimized VMs (M2) offer the highest memory configuration for a Compute Engine VM. They are well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as large in-memory databases and in-memory data analytics workloads. The M2 family offers up to 12 TB of memory and 416 VCPUs, enabling you to run scale-up workloads on GCP.

These custom and specialist VMs are generally more expensive than predefined VMs but provide more flexibility and specialist configuration for heavy workloads.

However, in the case of custom VMs, it's perhaps crossed your mind that there is a question as to how Google will give discounts on your custom machines. The issue is that custom machines don't really fall into a category, so they are not a fit with Google's standard machine type discount plan.

Instead, Google's billing plan for custom machine types requires Compute Engine to calculate the virtual CPU and memory usage and then applies the discount described by the sustained user's discount.

        <pre><p><strong>Machine Types for Compute Engine VMs</strong></p>
<p>Google provides various machine types for Compute Engine VMs, each suited for specific workloads. The main differences between high memory and high CPU machine types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Memory Machine Types: Best suited for applications that require more memory relative to the number of virtual CPUs. These machines start at 6.5 GB of RAM per virtual CPU, nearly double the amount of ram per VCPU as the standard type.</li>
<li>High CPU Machine Types: Best suited for applications that demand more virtual CPUs relative to memory. These machines start at 0.9 GB of RAM per virtual CPU.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specialist Machine Types</strong></p>
<p>For High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning (ML) workloads, Google provides specialist machine types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute Optimized VMs (C2): Expose high per-thread performance for compute-intensive workloads. Offer a greater than 40% performance improvement compared to current GCP VMs.</li>
<li>Memory Optimized VMs (M2): Provide the highest memory configuration for Compute Engine VMs, well-suited for memory-intensive workloads such as large in-memory databases and in-memory data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom Machine Types</strong></p>
<p>If predefined machine types don't fit your compute needs, you can create a custom machine type to customize CPU, memory, and GPU needs. However, custom machines don't fall into a category, making it challenging to apply discounts using Google's standard machine type discount plan. Instead, Compute Engine calculates the virtual CPU and memory usage and applies the sustained user's discount.</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Machine types are constantly being evaluated and may change or become unavailable in certain regions. Check the Web Console for availability before selecting a preconfigured type. Custom machine types are generally more expensive than predefined VMs but provide flexibility and specialist configuration for heavy workloads.</p></pre>
