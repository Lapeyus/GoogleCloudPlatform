        <pre><h1>Service Level Objectives (SLOs)</h1>
<h2>Understanding SLOs</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, SLOs aren't set at the maximum performance a service can achieve. Rather, the business will determine an appropriate  and achievable  level of the performance or reliability that the provider can realistically deliver.</p>
<h2>Importance of Realism</h2>
<p>After  all the service must be financially viable so we can't make it too  responsive
or too available because then it would be too expensive.
One important thing is that your SLOs are not immutable and they might change as you continually improve and upgrade  your service .</p>
<h2>Golden Monitoring Signals</h2>
<p>Also , keep  in mind the four  golden monitoring signals when creating your SLOS: latency, traffic, errors, and resource  saturation.</p>
<p>When designing your SLOS, it's important to be realistic  and not over optimistic. While we would all like to think  we have designed a service that is 100 percent reliable and available, that  is sadly rarely the case.</p>
<h2>Error Budget Methodology</h2>
<p>This is why many organisations use an error budget methodology when it comes to maintenance and managing service windows.
444</p>
<h3>Error Budget</h3>
<p>By taking a realistic approach to maintenance it is assumed that
every service will not run
perfectly. Hence, services are given
acceptable error limits for the SLOS that operate a bit like any financial  budget.</p>
<p>With an error budget, each service will be  given a set level  of credit which is a set amount of errors, which are measured  in downtime, that are considered acceptable, i.e.  normal and expected  maintenance and service downtime.</p>
<p>However, any errors in  excess of this budget are considered to be service outages .</p>
<p>You will commonly see error budgets displayed as  SLAs such as  99.9% and the like.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal with an error  budget is to  perform all the system maintenance and updates within this budget .</p>
<p>The error budget in effect provides a strict window of opportunity  for unscheduled maintenance and servicing.</p>
<p>Each month there  will be opportunities for implement  changes and applying  updates but as the days go by the error budget is
replenished.</p>
<h3>Service Requirements</h3>
<p>A key design focus is on the requirements that are important to the stakeholders, for example the business goals.</p>
<p>Requirements are also measurable for example; one operational requirement might be that the service must be highly responsive to users.</p>
<p>That requirement is now contained in an objective, such as; the system must respond to customer requests in no more than 400 milliseconds latency.</p>
<p>The design objective can then be mapped to a corresponding measurable service indicator, such as; measuring round trip time between receiving a user request and delivery of a result to the gateway.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1: Service Performance and Reliability</h3>
<p>This topic is centered around the concept of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and their relationship with service performance and reliability. It discusses how SLOs are not set at maximum performance levels, but rather at achievable levels that balance business needs with financial viability.</p>
<h3>Topic 2: Error Budgeting and Maintenance</h3>
<p>This topic focuses on the use of error budgets as a maintenance strategy for services. It explains how error budgets provide a framework for acceptable errors and downtime, allowing services to be maintained within a budgeted limit while minimizing service outages.</p>
<h3>Topic 3: Design Requirements and Objectives</h3>
<p>This topic emphasizes the importance of design requirements and objectives in defining service performance. It highlights the need to map operational requirements to measurable service indicators, such as latency and round trip time, to ensure that services meet stakeholder needs.</p></pre>
