        <pre><h1>Overview of Compute Engine VM Configuration Methods</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are several methods for configuring Virtual Machines (VMs) in Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific needs of the project.</p>
<h2>Web Console vs Cloudshell</h2>
<p>The Web Console is a graphical interface that makes it easy to build VMs, especially for beginners or inexperienced admins. However, as the number of VMs increases, the manual repetition required can become tedious. In this case, Cloudshell may be a more preferred method.</p>
<p>Cloudshell is the command line for the SDK, which can be accessed through the Web Console or installed locally on a laptop. Running commands to build VMs using Cloudshell is faster and less tedious than using the Web Console, especially when building multiple VMs.</p>
<h2>Automation with RESTful API</h2>
<p>If manual running of commands or complex configurations is not desired, the RESTful API can be used to automate the process. The API programmatically configures VMs by defining all the different options for environments and runs automatically with minimum intervention required.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Machine Type</h2>
<p>When deciding on a machine type, it's essential to consider the balance between CPU and memory usage. The standard machine type is best suited for applications that have a good balance between these two resources. Other machine types, such as high memory and high CPU, are better suited for specific use cases.</p>
<h2>Comparison of Machine Types</h2>
<p>| Machine Type | Virtual CPUs per GB of Memory |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | 3.75:1 |
| High Memory | 1:1 |
| High CPU | 4:1 |
| Shared Core | 2:1 |</p>
<p>Note: The ratios may vary depending on the specific configuration.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to configuring VMs in Compute Engine. The choice of method depends on the specific needs of the project, including the number of VMs, the level of automation required, and the balance between CPU and memory usage. By understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each method, developers can make informed decisions about which configuration method is best for their projects.</p></pre>

        <pre>There is no preferred method or one method being better than another as they all have their specific uses. For example, the Web Console is a tremendous method for beginners or inexperienced admins as it is a graphical interface with check boxes and drop-down selection menus. This makes it very easy to build a VM as you have all the options available to you and are led through the build process in an intuitive manner.

However, if you are building a few VMs, the web console soon becomes tedious due to the manual repetition required when configuring each VM in turn. In that case, Cloudshell may be the preferred method. Cloudshell is the command line for the SDK which can be conveniently accessed through the web console or if you want, you could install the SDK locally on your laptop.

Regardless of how you access the SDK, you will soon find that running commands to build VMs is far quicker and less tedious when building multiple VMs than using the web console. The advantage of Cloudshell is that you can run scripts or pre-configured multi-line configuration commands to build your VMs. These scripts can be readily edited and customized for example changing the VM name and then run with a simple cut and paste on the command line.

However, if you don't want to be manually running commands or the scripts are complex configurations, then you would probably eventually want to automate the process. In this case, you might want to use the RESTful API. The API will programmatically configure your VMs by defining all the different options for your environments and then run automatically with minimum intervention required.

A good tip for using either the Cloudshell command line or the RESTful API is to configure the first VM instance through the Web Console, and then ask Compute Engine for the equivalent REST request or command line code. Then you can copy and paste this into your own scripts or commands. This way, you not only avoid any typos but you can soon build up a library of scripts for each VM.

Regardless of the method you use to interface with the Compute type that matches your environment, Engine you are still going to first decide on the VM parameters that your application or service requires. The first step is to decide on which of the different machine types that are currently available fits your needs. These predefined machine types are managed by Compute Engine and come in four classes: standard, high memory, Shared core machines or the micro VMs as they are often called are high CPU, and shared core memory machines.

Great in development environments especially when prototyping solutions because they are cost-effective for running small non-resource intensive applications. However, these are unlikely to be sufficient for production environments, for that you would need to look to the other three alternatives; standard, high memory and high CPU machine types.

The difference between the machine types listed is the ratio of number of virtual CPUs to the amount of memory. The standard machine type is best suited to applications that have a good balance between CPU and memory usage. Specifically, standard machine types start out at 3.75 gigs of RAM per virtual CPU, but they can go all the way up to 64 virtual CPUs with 240 gigs of RAM.
