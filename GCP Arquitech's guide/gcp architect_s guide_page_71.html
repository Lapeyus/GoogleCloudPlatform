        <pre>Google Cloud Platform has its own GCSM, which is a fully managed service built on the high-performance Envoy sidecar proxy and the open source Istio service mesh. This provides container API support for microservices running in Kubernetes. The Google Cloud Service Mesh supports end-to-end encryption between services using mTLS (mutual TLS), as well as granular traffic control, routing, and authorization policy. It also integrates with Stackdriver to monitor and alert on key metrics, all achieved without changing your application code.

Istio on GKE provides a managed, mature service mesh that can be deployed across both the Cloud and on-premise networks with just one click. However, the real utility of Istio lies in its ability to provide infrastructure abstraction and process automation in a cloud or hybrid cloud environment.

Automation is increasingly becoming a key aspect of organizations' development processes, delivering efficiencies, velocity, and quality. Many organizations strive for continuous improvement and rapid deployment to deliver their products. As a result, development has become a pipeline-based approach for automating application upgrades and rapid deployment.

Google Cloud Service Mesh based on Istio integrates seamlessly with continuous delivery systems and deployment pipelines. For example, you can configure your pipeline to deploy Istio VirtualServices to manage granular traffic management or even in-flight A-B testing without manual intervention. Istio also works well with modern GitOps workflows due to its declarative configuration model.

In this scenario, the source control serves as the central source of truth for both your application and infrastructure configuration.

Traffic Director is GCP's fully managed traffic control plane for service mesh. It provides an abstraction used to deliver microservices and modern applications. The service mesh data plane is deployed through service proxies like Envoy, controlling the flow of traffic and enforcing policy, configuration, and intelligence. With Traffic Director, it's easy to configure traffic control policies.

You can also use Traffic Director to deploy simple load balancing as well as deploy it across multiple regions as VMs or containers. Additionally, Traffic Director enables global load balancing with automatic cross-region overflow and failover. Some advanced features like request routing and percentage-based traffic splitting enable seamless scalability within Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine environments.
