        <pre><p>The article discusses the importance of controlling and monitoring service accounts in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Here are the main points:</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Each resource or application should have its own service account.</li>
<li>Service accounts should have specific roles assigned to them, with a maximum of 10-20 roles per account.</li>

        <pre>The answer to this depends on your architecture but as a rule of thumb, each resource or an application should have its own service account. The roles assigned to the service account will vary, with some having 10-20 roles assigned, which is a clear sign that your application needs to be decomposed into smaller modules as that is a concentration risk.

If you consider the risk, you'll see known as a concentration problem if a user is granted permission to use that service account. Service accounts are another resource and identity, requiring verbose identifiers so they can be readily recognized and their function understood. Indeed, with service accounts, it's a good practice to incorporate the role it performs into the name.

This makes it easier to understand during troubleshooting but also cuts down on potential errors when assigning service accounts to a group. Sometimes this may not be possible as the service account serves many roles, which is a concentration problem and you should look to making the service account's role more specific.

The problem with having too many roles or permissions assigned to a service account is that when it's assigned to a group, all group members may then inherit all the service account's permissions. They cannot use the permissions directly but can access all the resources available to the service account by connecting through it even though they have no need or reason to.

This is a significant security hole that you do need to audit regularly. You will be perhaps surprised to discover just how many permissions you are granting indirectly to users via poorly defined service accounts. Some ways to mitigate this risk is to use a strong naming convention that stipulates that it's a service account, as in logs and reports, it just shows up as an email address.

So add a prefix to identify it as a service account. Secondly, if you can include its function or role into the name so you can clearly define its appropriate usage. Limit the service accounts' own roles and permissions to specific resources and tasks. It's better to create more specific service accounts that to continually keep empowering an existing account with more functions and roles.

This begs the question, how many service accounts do we need? Indirectly, users have access way beyond their own role as they can access everything that the service account can. For example, if you try to consider who can access a resource and what permissions it starts to become a very difficult question to answer.

This is why GCP uses an open-source product they developed themselves called Forseti Security to answer these questions. The way Forseti works is that you simply give it your list of users, groups, and their roles, and Forseti then builds a model from your access policy and provides a query interface. You can then ask it questions such as, 'who can delete this VM?' or 'what resources can this user access?'

A final point before we conclude our discussion on control and move on to visibility is don't rely on default service accounts. The issue is that you shouldn't rely on just having the project's own default service account. Every project in GCP gets a default service account upon creation, but they are not immutable and the roles and permissions are not guaranteed as they can be depreciated at any time.

So only use them for initial testing do not use them in production. When we consider visibility, we're going to be using tools such as logs, Stackdriver, and Forseti, which we introduced earlier. These are the tools that we need to discover who or what service accounts can access resources and with what permissions.

We need to be able to have visibility into the underlying permissions matrix in order to understand what is going on and who is doing what.

</li>
<li>
<p>What is the relationship between service account roles and security risks in group assignments?
Answer: When a group member is assigned to a service account with multiple roles, they inherit all those roles, increasing the risk of security breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can using more specific service accounts help mitigate security risks?
Answer: By limiting the number of roles and permissions assigned to each service account, reducing the risk of users inheriting unnecessary permissions.</p>
