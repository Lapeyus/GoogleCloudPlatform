Communication Via Public IPs

For example, if software development is Project A, and test engineering is Project B, you can assign different people to different roles in the projects for management separation or what is called separation of duties. To achieve this, you should consider segmenting the system up into multiple projects to enable more granular access control.

The issue here is that a network cannot span across different projects. So using separate projects implies that the VMs must communicate via external IP addresses across the Internet.

Bastion Host

Another common network design makes use of a bastion host to provide internal resources and VMs with isolation from the internet. Bastion hosts provide an external facing point of entry into a network containing private network instances.

In this scenario, only the bastion host is configured with a public external IP address on its interface, while all other internal VM instances use the private internal address space addresses. The bastion host is therefore acting like a proxy or gatekeeper for internet access for both ingress and egress traffic.

This bastion host model can also be deployed to provide a single point for fortification or for network audit purposes, which is controllable as its SSH services can be either started or stopped to permit or block any inbound SSH connections coming from the Internet. For example, should you have an application or service running on an internal VM instance that is provided to an internal corporate audience but requires remote administrative access, then there's no need to provide this instance with an external IP address.

        <pre><h3>Network Isolation Models for Resource Security</h3>
<h4>Overview of Network Isolation</h4>
<p>Network isolation is a crucial aspect of resource security, preventing the compromise of one part from spreading to other parts. This can be achieved through various models, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Isolation</strong>: Resources are isolated to prevent communication between them over private IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Via Public IPs</strong>: VMs communicate via external IP addresses across the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Bastion Host</strong>: A bastion host provides internal resources and VMs with isolation from the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Resource Isolation Models</h4>
<p>Resource isolation models involve isolating resources to prevent communication between them. This can be achieved through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VPC Network Peering</strong>: Allowing resources to communicate over a private address space.</li>
<li><strong>Separate Projects</strong>: Isolating VMs into separate projects, but within the same zone.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Communication Via Public IPs</h4>
<p>Communication via public IPs involves assigning different people to different roles in projects for management separation or separation of duties. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segmenting the system up into multiple projects.</li>
<li>Using separate projects implies that VMs must communicate via external IP addresses across the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bastion Host Model</h4>
<p>The bastion host model provides internal resources and VMs with isolation from the internet. A bastion host is configured with a public external IP address on its interface, while other internal VM instances use private internal address space addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Point for Fortification</strong>: The bastion host can be deployed as a single point for fortification or network audit purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Controllable SSH Services</strong>: The bastion host's SSH services can be started or stopped to permit or block any inbound SSH connections coming from the Internet.</li>

        <pre><h3>Topic 1</h3>
<p>Resource Isolation and Network Segmentation
The text discusses the importance of isolating resources in a network to prevent compromise and unauthorized communication. This is achieved through various methods, including using VPC network peering, segmenting systems into multiple projects, and deploying bastion hosts.</p>
<h3>Topic 2</h3>
<p>Communication Across Projects and Zones
This topic highlights the challenges of communicating between different projects and zones within a network. It discusses how separate projects imply that VMs must communicate via external IP addresses across the Internet, and how this can be mitigated using VPC network peering or bastion hosts.</p>
<h3>Topic 3</h3>
<p>Bastion Host Deployment and Fortification
The text explains the role of bastion hosts in providing internal resources and VMs with isolation from the internet. Bastion hosts act as a proxy or gatekeeper for internet access, controlling inbound SSH connections and allowing for fortification or network audit purposes.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the main purpose of isolating resources in a network?
Answer: To prevent compromise of one part from spreading to other parts, while also preventing them from communicating with each other over private IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can VPC network peering be used to overcome the inconvenience of resource isolation?
Answer: By allowing resources to communicate over a private address space, enabling them to share resources and data without compromising security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the benefit of isolating VMs into separate projects within the same zone for identity and access management?
Answer: It enables more granular access control and separation of duties, making it easier to manage user roles and permissions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does the use of a bastion host affect the security of internal resources and VMs?
Answer: By providing an external facing point of entry into the network, while keeping internal VM instances isolated from the internet, reducing the attack surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the advantages of using separate projects to segment a system for access control?
Answer: It enables more granular access control, separation of duties, and better management of user roles and permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does VPC network peering impact the communication between resources in isolated networks?
Answer: By allowing them to communicate over a private address space, enabling secure data sharing and collaboration without compromising security.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suppose you have an application running on an internal VM instance that requires remote administrative access for corporate employees. How would you implement this using a bastion host model?
Answer: You would configure the bastion host with a public external IP address, allowing only inbound SSH connections from the corporate audience, while keeping the internal VM instance isolated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some scenarios where resource isolation is crucial in network design?
Answer: Examples include preventing compromise of one part from spreading to other parts, ensuring separation of duties, and providing secure access control for sensitive resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you use VPC network peering to enable communication between resources in isolated networks?
Answer: By creating a VPC network peering connection between the two networks, allowing them to share resources and data over a private address space.</p>
