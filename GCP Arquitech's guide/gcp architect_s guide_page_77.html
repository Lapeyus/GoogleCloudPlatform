        <pre>Anthos is a collection of complementary services that helps manage containers in either cloud or on-premises environments. Anthos brings benefits to all areas of the business.

From a developer's perspective, we can consider Anthos as supplying a Kubernetes container management platform. It enables developers to deploy containers and microservices-based architectures. It does this by providing Git-compliant management and CI/CD workflows for configuration. Additionally, it provides the code for deploying Anthos Configuration Management as well as code-free protection of services via mTLS and instrumentation using Istio and Stackdriver.

Anthos also has inbuilt support for GCP Marketplace, allowing developers to easily drop off-the-shelf products into clusters.

When considering Operations, Anthos provides centralized, efficient, and deployment templates as well as the management of clusters. The benefit to operators is that Anthos enables them to use single command deployment of new clusters with GKE and GKE On-Prem (gkectl). It also provides a platform for centralized configuration management and compliance, as well as simplified deployment and roll back via Anthos Config Management and Git check-ins.

As a result, Anthos provides operators with a single pane of glass visibility across all clusters from infrastructure through to application performance and topology with Stackdriver.

From a security perspective, we can consider Anthos to enforce security standards on clusters, deployed applications, and even configuration management. Anthos provides a central point for audit and a secured workflow via Git-compliant repositories. It also provides compliance enforcement of cluster configurations using namespaces and labels as well as inherited configurations and the securing of microservices via Istio and in-cluster mTLS certificates.

Furthermore, with Anthos Migrate, you can now let Anthos auto-migrate your VMs from on-premises or other clouds directly into containers in GKE. This new migration technology lets you easily and quickly migrate your infrastructure without modifications to the original VMs or applications.
