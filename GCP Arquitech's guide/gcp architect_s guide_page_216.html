        <pre><h1>Business Logic</h1>
<h2>Definition and Purpose</h2>
<p>The business logic determines how the application process works in fulfilling its purpose.</p>
<h3>Example Use Case</h3>
<p>An example would be in banking, as the business logic would determine how the application handled a financial transaction and which accounts would be debited or credited and in which order.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Business Logic</h2>
<p>By definition, business logic operates on data, which means processing some code. Essentially, the business logic layer design is where you'll consider all of the cloud processing options in order to determine what services the business logic code will need to use.</p>
<h1>Microservices Architecture</h1>
<h2>Overview and Benefits</h2>
<p>In computer software, business logic or domain logic is part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed.</p>
<h3>Microservices Design</h3>
<p>Microservices design is a popular approach to applications design in the cloud as they leverage small, stateless processing code to provide scalability and resiliency. Microservices architecture can be thought of as independently deployable, small modular single purpose functions.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Microservices</h2>
<p>As such microservices can be used like tiny building blocks of single function micro-applications. Building application using these functional building blocks is very efficient and well suited for the cloud. This is due to each modular service running as a unique process that is going to contribute to some individual business goal.</p>
<h3>Communication Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Also microservices can communicate effectively through a lightweight mechanism such as Cloud Pub/Sub, which is GCP message queuing service.</p></pre>

Microservices
In computer software, business logic or domain logic is part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. Microservices design is a popular approach to applications design in the cloud as they leverage small, stateless processing code to provide scalability and resiliency.

Microservices architecture can be thought of as independently deployable, small modular single purpose functions. As such microservices can be used like tiny building blocks of single function micro-applications. Building application using these functional building blocks is very efficient and well suited for the cloud. This is due to each modular service running as a unique process that is going to contribute to some individual business goal.

Also, microservices can communicate effectively through a lightweight mechanism such as Cloud Pub/Sub, which is GCP message queuing service.

        <pre><h3>Business Logic and Microservices Architecture</h3>
<p>The business logic determines how an application processes data to fulfill its purpose. In banking, for example, the business logic would decide how financial transactions are handled, including which accounts are debited or credited in what order.</p>
<p>Business logic operates on data, processing code that defines real-world business rules for creating, storing, and changing data. When designing a cloud-based application, it's essential to consider all available cloud processing options to determine the services required by the business logic layer.</p>
<h3>Microservices Design</h3>
<p>Microservices design is a popular approach to applications in the cloud, leveraging small, stateless processing code to provide scalability and resiliency. This architecture can be thought of as independently deployable, small modular single-purpose functions that can be used like tiny building blocks for single-function micro-applications.</p>
<p>Each modular service runs as a unique process contributing to an individual business goal, making it efficient and well-suited for the cloud. Microservices also communicate effectively through lightweight mechanisms such as Cloud Pub/Sub, a GCP message queuing service, enabling seamless communication between services.</p></pre>

        <pre><h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>What determines how an application process works in fulfilling its purpose?
Answer: The business logic.</li>
<li>In the context of banking, what does the business logic determine for financial transactions?
Answer: How to debit or credit accounts and in which order.</li>
<li>What is the primary function of the business logic layer design?
Answer: To consider cloud processing options and determine necessary services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analytical Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>How do microservices architecture and business logic relate to each other?
Answer: Microservices are designed to operate independently, with their own unique purpose, which aligns with the concept of business logic.</li>
<li>What is the benefit of using microservices in cloud-based applications?
Answer: Scalability and resiliency due to small, stateless processing code that can be deployed independently.</li>
<li>How does Cloud Pub/Sub facilitate communication between microservices?
Answer: It provides a lightweight mechanism for microservices to communicate effectively.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Application Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design a simple banking application using business logic and microservices. Describe how the application would handle financial transactions.
Answer: The application would use business logic to determine which accounts to debit or credit, in what order, and utilize microservices to process each transaction independently.</li>
<li>How can a cloud-based application benefit from using microservices architecture?
Answer: By providing scalability and resiliency due to small, stateless processing code that can be deployed independently.</li>
<li>What are some potential challenges when implementing business logic and microservices in a cloud-based application?
Answer: Ensuring consistency across different services, handling errors and exceptions, and maintaining data integrity.</li>
