        <pre>The way to do this is to create two separate service accounts. For example, service account 1 will have Editor permissions for project A. Another service account, for example service account 2, will have object viewer permissions. By assigning a service account to the appropriate microservice, we can control their individual access rights. In this way, you can scope permissions for VMs without having to recreate the VMs as Cloud IAM essentially lets you slice a project into different microservices, each with access permissions to different resources. You do this by creating service accounts to represent each one.

You can assign the service accounts to the VMs when they are created, and a big benefit is that you don't have to worry about managing credentials as GCP handles security for you.

Chapter 15 - Data Storage Services: A Deep-Dive

Data is often characterized by the 3Vs: variety, which refers to its structural variability as to how similar or different the data can be; velocity, which is essentially how fast the data arrives; and finally, volatility, which refers to how long the data retains value and therefore how long it needs to be stored and made accessible. There is also a 4V, which is veracity, a measure of the correctness and integrity of the data, but that isn't relevant to our topic regarding cloud data storage methods.

Nonetheless, when we contemplate the various data storage techniques, it doesn't really matter from an application's point of view whether the storage technology is a database or an object store. What is important, from the application perspective, is that the technology behaves like a service, which provides efficient and reliable storing and retrieving of the data.

When you take a look at GCP's service offerings for data storage, there are many services to choose from. In previous chapters, we discussed all of these at a high functional level and compared their individual suitability for specific tasks. In this chapter, we will take a deeper dive into the workings of each of them: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore/Filestore, and Cloud Bigtable.

By assigning a service account to the appropriate microservice, we can control their individual access rights. In this way, you can scope permissions for VMs without having to recreate the VMs as Cloud IAM essentially lets you slice a project into different microservices, each with access permissions to different resources. You do this by creating service accounts to represent each one.

You can assign the service accounts to the VMs when they are created, and a big benefit is that you don't have to worry about managing credentials as GCP handles security for you.

Chapter 15 - Data Storage Services: A Deep-Dive

Data is often characterized by the 3Vs: variety, which refers to its structural variability as to how similar or different the data can be; velocity, which is essentially how fast the data arrives; and finally, volatility, which refers to how long the data retains value and therefore how long it needs to be stored and made accessible. There is also a 4V, which is veracity, a measure of the correctness and integrity of the data, but that isn't relevant to our topic regarding cloud data storage methods.

Nonetheless, when we contemplate the various data storage techniques, it doesn't really matter from an application's point of view whether the storage technology is a database or an object store. What is important, from the application perspective, is that the technology behaves like a service, which provides efficient and reliable storing and retrieving of the data.

When you take a look at GCP's service offerings for data storage, there are many services to choose from. In previous chapters, we discussed all of these at a high functional level and compared their individual suitability for specific tasks. In this chapter, we will take a deeper dive into the workings of each of them: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore/Filestore, and Cloud Bigtable.

In this way, you can scope permissions for VMs without having to recreate the VMs as Cloud IAM essentially lets you slice a project into different microservices, each with access permissions to different resources. You do this by creating service accounts to represent each one.

You can assign the service accounts to the VMs when they are created, and a big benefit is that you don't have to worry about managing credentials as GCP handles security for you.

Data is often characterized by the 3Vs: variety, which refers to its structural variability as to how similar or different the data can be; velocity, which is essentially how fast the data arrives; and finally, volatility, which refers to how long the data retains value and therefore how long it needs to be stored and made accessible. There is also a 4V, which is veracity, a measure of the correctness and integrity of the data, but that isn't relevant to our topic regarding cloud data storage methods.

Nonetheless, when we contemplate the various data storage techniques, it doesn't really matter from an application's point of view whether the storage technology is a database or an object store. What is important, from the application perspective, is that the technology behaves like a service, which provides efficient and reliable storing and retrieving of the data.

When you take a look at GCP's service offerings for data storage, there are many services to choose from.
